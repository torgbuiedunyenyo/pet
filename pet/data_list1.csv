Problems
"To have a stable life, and many other reasons, like travel, meet people and experience something that not many people experience ","Sometimes you don't get enough time to eat everything because you get 15 minutes to eat and take the trash out, which makes it around 11min to eat and 4min to take the trash out",You have to eat as fast as if you hadn't eaten in 3 days,By giving at least 5min more to eat
To provide for my future family and because I don't feel mature enough to go straight to college,"Often times for non-mre meals, I find myself finishing my food and still being a little hungry at the end",Likely in the same way,Simply putting more food on our plates or allowing seconds after you finish
For my family and to better my self,I got the corners right but I get it ripped up every morning ,You have to make you bed a certain way but I can't make it to ,No
To help my family,Been messing up my insides ,Get ready to not be able to poop as much and get backed up or poop everyday,Add salt
My dad ,Just want more phone time that's all ,It's tough but it's manageable at least two times a week instead of one ,Gift good troops more phone time and allow them to earn phone time thru various events or time hacks 
"I joined for educational benefits, stability, and to serve my country.",One thing that could have been done differently is that training is more centralized so Drill Sergeants know what we've learned and what we've not learned.,Have the drill sergeants talk about a way to centralize training so it's the same and know what has been done.,Having drill sergeants  talk about what they've taught and how they taught it.
In joined for new and better opportunities ,It's hot in South Carolina so ac isn't too strong ,The air conditioner isn't good and they make us write a lot of words for discipline purposes ,Telling drill sergeants to be not unreasonable and better maintenance in the barracks/bays 
My dad was successful in the cyber security field so I am trying to do that and get a high level clearance through the army. I also don't want to be in any type of student debt or anything like that and I like physically challenging myself ,I have a lot of friends and family that I spend time with and communicate with on a daily basis at home and I kinda uprooting myself from that. It just sucks right now but it'll all pay off when I graduate ,As much as I am happy with the career I'll be starting I miss my social life and living at home with my family ,Training 
For job opportunities ,Like when we have to do a task as a platoon people dont listen and do there own things sometimes and it gets frustrating ,That at points people would just don't work together to get something done and that leads to corrective training down the line ,No I think I've pretty much covered what I think on the matter 
"I've always wanted to join. I love my country and want to defend all that it stands for. My grandfather was also in the Army Corps of Engineers during WWII, but not many other family members. I want to honor my family and my country by being the best soldier I can possibly be.",The chow is fairly small portions. Servers do not serve full scoops or portions of food most of the time,The chow is fairly small portions. Servers do not serve full scoops or portions of food most of the time,Maybe a lack of availability of good amounts of food to give to troops? Also the servers need to stop serving half scoops of food or broken pieces of food and give full servings in order for me to be a little bit fuller,Just make sure everyone gets a full serving or up the amounts of food portions that are allotted to each soldier
New start on life,Better tasting food and more time to eat,I have 15 minutes to eat food that doesn't even taste good,Let me make me the food
To set up a future for myself ,more food ,I wish we got more food here because I be starving a lot ,No
2003,On Sundays I wish we had our phones for 1 hour,Have my phone a longer amount of time on sundays,Idk
"College is expensive, I felt a need to stand up and serve my country, I felt like i would fit in better to the military than college",I don't get fed enough i feel like and when i do i don't get enough time to eat it all,the food does not taste good and i do not get enough food to eat. whenever i do receive enough food i don't get enough time to eat it all.,give more time for the recruits to eat and give them good food not fake food that makes you constipated 
I don't want my parents paying for my tuition anymore. I joined so the army can pay for mine.," Knowing the chain of command, the creed, weapons, navigation ","""There are a lot of stuff that is somewhat required to know prior to joining the army. The more you know, the more you can be prepared. The more you are prepared the easier military would be for you.""",Meditate
I was looking to travel the around the USA and world and to get a job I can have afterwards so I can eventually start a family and business ,So we have to go row by row to get our food but I would like to sit down as soon as we get out ohone ,Ohone ,Let the people who get back to there spots sit down and eat right away 
Career advancement,We had many people arguing with each other and not actually doing their jobs on fire guard or other expectations,"In BCT, there at times is a disconnect in communications, respect, and responsibility among fellow platoon members. This needs to be addressed or trainees need a way to voice and alleviate these concerns because too many people pull all of the weight",There needs to be a more thorough or accessible means for reporting this information to drill sergeants or others in control that keeps platoon members safe and anonymous while also addressing and solving these issues.
Wanted to serve ,Maybe the COVID situation could have been done differently ,COVID should be handle differently,There shouldn't be COVID testing when people have to be quarantined anyway
I wanted the warrior title,Longer personal time to do things like write letters and do homework ,Having more personal time,They need to be on the same page
To make my mom proud ,I don't have anything in mind,I don't know ,Yes
I joined to further my career in Healthcare and to try and help as many people as I can ,We spent a more time just taking notes on what we were learning. For example with learning about land navigation it would have been nice to be able to use maps and a compass as we were learning about in the the classroom ,Being able to do what is being taught in the classroom setting as it is being taught to you ,More organization and communication between the drill sergeants that are in charge if the platoon so they know what has already been taught and where they need to continue on from 
To get in better shape,"Some food was good, but stuff such as the eggs could be better or at least not cold","Some food was good, but other food could be better",Unsure
Because I felt that it was the best choice for my future considering my interest and that It would give me more options than if I went to college,Just wish that I would be able to have bigger portions of food since we burn so many calories through the day from doing physical training ,I would say that I wish I had more food to eat since that I burn so much energy while we work out ,I think it's because we can't eat at the DFAC because we are in yellow phase so they can only send us so much food at once and the company has to ration it so that every troop gets the same amount of food,I don't think there's much of a way to fix the problem other than having COVID go away so that there won't be a yellow phase 
I want to further my education and have a lil more stability ,The portions of food here is not enough for the pt and extra curriculum things they gave us to do ,That with all the physical training we do here the food and the allotted time to eat it is simply not enough ,Someone in rank get the defac on the right page 
I needed to get to college and lose weight,had i joined my 11 grade i wouldve been done with basic training ,i would say going to basic 11th grade would be better,i just might become a recruiter
I wanted to setup my future with my significant other ,"BCT is tough on me mentally. I miss home and it's really hard to be away from my significant other. It brings me tears to know that I'm away from them. Also, I'm scared I won't make all the events ",BCT is a very mentally challenging experience. More mentally than physically ,Take things one day at a time. Talk to other battle buddies about how I'm feeling
2003,No I do not have anything that i wished wouldve been different , ,"
"
"I wanted to serve since I was little, one because my brother was in to army and I felt like it was  in my personal morals to serve.",I wish were spent more time learning our curriculum and memorizing and leaning what we need to know than having to stop learning to leave and do other things of,"later, or the best day.",Give a longer eating period and in service church.
To better myself serve my country and make my family proud,We didn't sleep the first 2 days  some of us had no sheets or pillows and most things we were issued were in some way wrong a lot of us didn't receive the full amount of clothing or other items we were supposed to receive the orders from the drill sergeants were vague and the personal who worked their other than the drill sergeants were all very rude and treated us like we weren't worth their time.,120th doesn't do their job verry well mostly because of their limited resources I believe ,Again mabey more time for rest before starting reception as I arrived at midnight and didn't sleep for at least 2 nights
I don't know yet ,I wouldn't change anythin that I've done so far ,BCT is hard but worth it In the end so keep pushin ,Make friends always look for the good in every situation 
My family is full of successful commissioned officers,The lunch and dinner often only had a single piece of meat that did not have more than 10 grams of protein in it. The MREs have always had a great amount of all nutrients though.,A single small piece of meat is not enough to be sustainable,Have whoever prepares meals allocate more protein into the food
"I joined so that I can take care of my self and and my future family and be able to take them to the hospital when they need to,and to have more structure and discipline in my life ",Yes ,"It's tough but we are fed,and taken care of and our need are met but we still workout and we still learn to be soldiers ",No everything is okay 
Benefits,No ,No improvement necessary,No 
I was recruited ,I'm not 100% mentally here,It's self explanatory ,Yes
Long story ,"It's stained and filled with dirt, spots, spilled drinks etc because of previous soldiers who had to exercise or eat or stand in that area. Then we eat on this same area","We stand, exercise and eat on the same spots",Maybe providing some sort of cover to separate were we'd eat from where we exercise and stand and sweat etc
I was scared to go to college and I wanted to serve my country,Like back home i wish I would've prepared physically for the intense PT of BCT,"The PT here isn't too hard but also isn't a cakewalk, especially if your platoon struggles with directions",Not really 
I decided to join because I'm the person that really likes helping other people and I know that if I make it in the army I will be able to help other people out,Like drill sergeants have like a family time before personal time,I would say it would make troops feel more like home knowing that drill sergeants are there to make them better,No
I joined to better myself and to serve my country ,It was 90% standing around and waiting. We also were permitted very little sleep. ,We were sleep deprived for no good reason. ,Better management of time and resources during reception. 
So I can get the job I want when I'm out,Better food,I want better food,Making better food in the dfac
To try and get my mom's citizenship,I felt pushed to be better at the tasks asked of me,The drill sergeants will push you and show you how to do the things you are told to do. Even if it tskes a little bit of corrective training,I don't know
"Well I wanted to provide a good future for myself and for the girl of my dreams Abby, she means a lot to me and I think the Army will provide a good start to her and I's future ","Well there was a lot of sitting around, it was more of a mental game and I feel like the Drill Sergeants could have respected our personal belongings and items that will keep us going throughout basic training. I'm holding onto my goals to keep going but it's hard to maintain that when the Drill Sergeants are crapping on that dream ","The Drill Sergeants are not respecting your personal business and belongings, they need to know that during BCT, these items keep us going and it doesn't help when the DS isn't respecting that. ","Have the DS respect our personal belongings. They need to know that's what keeps us going, it's not JUST the battle buddies "
To serve a country I love ,Worked out more lost a little more weight ran a little more I'm in good shape now as it is though just it could always be better ,Go to the gym and get in better shape ,Get recruiters to be more motivating 
Travel and experience ,Terrible judgment and wrong standards,Drill sergeant McCoy was a terrible leader,Other then real food and more arm emerges we good
tuition ,more food time would be nice ,it would be nice to have more time to eat,give trainees more time to eat food and allow trading MRE's to increase moral  
pick up a skill ,i wouldn't change or do anything differently ,the training is tough but good ,drill sergeants making a presentation of what to expect perhaps
"Job skills, lots of benefits, and I've been interested in the service since childhood",working hard every day and obeying orders.,"its like packing for a last minute vacation every day, make sure to show up with all the gear you need slightly ahead of time.",keep the stress on the the trainees. being late and missing gear is not good.
For financial aid in college,I miss my home and family a lot,I would say that personally you'd have to think about coming to bct very deeply ,I'd honestly just appreciate just a little more phone time which would be great
I wanted to try something instead of just working for a check base on the hours I work and I decided to try the army also the 20 year retirement doesn't sound bad at all the health and dental coverage and also to get my US citizenship and get my education without getting to pay for it ,When we get time to go is only 15 min but we take 3 to go to the bay and then is all crowned that at the end is only like 4 min ,You get 15 min to go to the restroom but in does 15 you take 8 or 6 min to go back and for the bay if your stomach doesn't feel good and you take longer then what you were giving you get smoke ,No 
To become a person who matters and is of importance ,Basic is supposed to suck stop trying to improve it,Embrace the suck ,Not sure 
Grow as an individual ,We seat in line all day every day ,We seat in line all day ,Do it at recruiting center 
Benefits ,It could have more flavor,"The food is""good""",I do not know
"A lot of reasons, one of them is I got the opportunity to go to university o colleague ",I don't think so ,If somebody ask me bout' the army. Imma say is 99 mentality and 1% workout ,Not sure. 
I want to set up a future for my girlfriend and I,More training. There is too much time to sit and think about what you miss at home and that can affect someone's decision on following through with the army,You have a lot of down time of just sitting and waiting and thinking about your family and the people at you love back at home so just give us something else to do,Just keep us busy with things we need to know
"To set an example for my younger siblings, and the educational benefits",things of that nature ,Instructions that were given are not the same instructions  throughout the transitioning process into bct from reception ,No sure exactly just them they communicate more to better prepare trainees for success 
2003,"I wish the way meals were given were different, there's hardly ever salt or pepper and we need salt with how much we are sweating ","The church services could be better too, there's not all religious practices offered. The drill sergeant said three different types of a religion were the same thing, and they aren't the drill sergeants also didn't respect our beliefs by the way they rudely interrupted service and cursed at us right when we were dismissed from service ","The first one, the cooks. Although the food is normally good, it normally always needs salty or pepper and it's hardly ever provided. And the second one, the drill sergeants who don't respect trainees religious belief ","Inform the people who send our meals to us, to remember to put salt and pepper along with it. And for the church services, provide all religions and tell the drill sergeants to have respect for trainees religions "
College ,Idk,Idk,No
i decided to join the army because my oldest brother was in the army and i also wanted my schooling to be paid for and to half a good retirement fund,the personal time schedule is hard because we don't get enough time with that being said it's hard for us to do things that we have to do because it overlaps into resting time ,basically saying that time for ourselves is taken away so it's hard for us to focus on ourselves in such little time ,"the drill sergeants intervening i feel like yes they're supposed to check on us but it doesn't give us enough time we need more time to shower, do laundry, etc ",yes i do
Okay ,Because it's on the rise ,We got a COVID test at reception which is the Processing Station when you're first coming in before you ship to basic training and we got one more test a few days into yellow phase which is quarantine we're almost at the end of two weeks and hearing about COVID on the rise ,Social distancing and maybe a COVID test per phase 
I join the army for college benefit and to serve the country ,"Yes, ",As long as you put a effort on everything or follow whatever drill sergeants says it's will be a great journey. ,No I don't have 
A variety of reasons ,I'm in company echo 334,Are you an actual person, I don't know what you're talking about 
"i decided to be in the army, for schooling and bigger opportunities ","i wish that, the food was better and that we could get out of the heat more and do more things ",as in learning how to run and things ,"Things that could make BCT, better is that we can choose what foods we eat and not eat as much meal ready to eat meals with comes out a bag, and that we didn't really just get into everything and go step by step
",And that we get more sleep 
I wanted to start my life . I want stability and the ability to impact and change the world .,In terms of learning styles . Everyone learns differently.,Everyone learns differently . And that should be taken into consideration.,No 
To be apart of something bigger than myself.,I don't wish to do anything differently ,I'm these last to weeks I wouldn't have done anything differently ,No
Because me grandpa was in the Army and I want to go to school and open a business ,Some people are continually doing the wrong thing and breaking the rules and the drill sergeants know who they are but all of us are getting punished cause the individuals are breaking the rules and not being honest about it,Like a whole team being punished for another teammate being irresponsible and breaking the rules ,"Trainees don't want to be here, or don't care that they are affecting everyone else, or don't care that they are not supposed to be doing what they're doing, and just can't work together and consider others",I honestly don't know cause it's not about the drill sergeants it's the trainees
For educational benefits ,We had like 3 drill sergeants and they all would give us different commands so somethings it was hard to know who to listen to and who to follow ,I'm not sure ,I think it's just because we are all new and it's hard to know exactly what to do in such a new environment with so many shockers  ,Give some more time to adjust maybe I'm not sure 
"My main reason was college, to help pay for it and to give me time to decide what I want to go to school for",allowed to get more so I have to ask other females for the products I need,There's not enough time for everyone to shower each night and we don't have access to the feminine products we need,"We are told we should have gotten the stuff already, but some of us have run out of what we bought already. And they just don't give us enough time to shower",?
To be a role model for those who look up to me,"Honestly, I don't think the army is for me ",Sometimes I feel like I have no motivation ,"I feel like possibly stress, constantly in a stressful environment "
To help with my parent's citizenship,The way that 120 battalion and Echo company handled situations that had to do with EO complaints ,It is like trying to file EO or Sexual Harassment complaints at your job but your boss not really caring about the situation ,Not really. I think the only thing that will help improve this is a situation where a trainee gets seriously hurt because the simple fact that the Army didn't take a complaint seriously.
what,we only get either 30 minutes or an hour of personal time at the end of the day. lights out is at 20:00 when in the blue book it should be 21:00,you don't get a lot of time to write letters or time to yourself before the next day ,give us more personal time 
summer camp ,,,
I joined because I wanted a purpose for my life and I knew the army could give me that. I also always want to help people and make a difference and I knew the army could do that ,Because of Covid trainees still have to wear mask even if were vaccinated and I wish the rules were different other than that BCT has been great so far ,I think everybody outside of BCT knows about Covid so I wouldn't have to describe it differently ,I do not because most of us are vaccinated or getting vaccinated right now 
To travel ,At reception and here there has been the same group of people causing issues and we all just keep getting group talks,That nothing gets resolved here,To get it together 
2000,Echo ,I wish when someone messed up only they get in trouble instead of the entire platoon because most of the platoon tries to correct the individual on multiple accounts but they still ignore orders and the whole platoon suffer daily ,I definitely think giving the girls time to sit down as a platoon and talk without letting anyone lash out or single people out. Let the girls have an hour or so a week to let them get some stuff off there chest 
Family and school,Our ACFT is next week and I would a little more confident if we worked more on endurance based workouts to help us with the 2 miles ,We would only work on body weight exercises and barely any running. And we need to do a 2 mile run and haven't been prepared at all ,Longer endurance PT sessions 
I decided to join the Army because I wanted to make a difference ,I do not like the bay I am in ,The sleeping area that I was assigned to is not good,Changing bays 
My mom didn't get the chance to finish her years so I'm fallowing in her path,"I think all the drill sergeants have great communication and they demonstrate everything great, the way we do things everyday is good, and they give us plenty of of latrine breaks",They make is enjoyable but still tuff both physically and mentally ,No
2002,"No, anything that could have been done differently is what I could have done better. Like just being more aware of what was going on that day, being told what we are doing the next week ",Like when you're in school and your teacher tells you what the agenda for the day/week is. Like we had a test the other day and we only found out because a drill sergeant came into the room and asked about it.,I think Lack of communication between the drill sergeants and then communication between the trainees and drill sergeants. One drill sergeant will tell us to do something and then our other one will tell us something different. Also I'm sure the drill sergeants are super busy having to take care of so many people that they may get distracted,"Umm, to be honest, I can't think of anything. I believe that's just something that the people in charge will have to figure out for themselves, since we don't know their personal lives and all. It's easy to forget what you've said and done"
No problem,I wished that there were some separate punishments for people not doing the right thing since its not fair for people that do,Also i wished the food had batter flavor,I would say except for people outside of BCT that if one person constantly mess up then the people that don't have to take repercussions for then  ,I just think its people that don't want to be hear causing it
My parents and brother have all served in the Army. My husband is active Army currently. I wanted to help him support our family,"Just the small stuff. One Bay does something wrong, but both bays are punished. ","The girls are split up into two rooms to sleep in called Bays. If the girls in one room does something wrong, the room that didn't do anything wrong get punished too",To have the Drill Sergeants mete out punishments to the parties that caus the issues
For my sister,I just don't like my bay that's it.,I didn't like most of the people I stayed in a common shared area with.,Things have been done and haven't been working. I just gave up
I wanted to make a future for myself and thought it would be a great opportunity to learn and grow. ,There's a lot of drama that would go on and I would want to switch bays to get out of it.,That there's conflicts with the other girls sometimes ,I'm not sure what could be done 
Wanted to serve and be able to go to school ,I wished I had prepared more physically and did some more research ,I wish I exercised more,Make sure that people have the right information to prepare before hand 
"To follow in my families footsteps, and get some direction in my life. ",Almost every meal that we got there was not enough for the entire company and the drill sergeants would have to go back for more. ,"Imagine going to a wedding reception, the catering company knew how many people would be at the reception, but they only sent enough food for a portion so the serving staff had to go back to feed the rest of the guests",Not really aside from double checking numbers
"To make a difference, benefits, stability while figuring out life",On what,What was the question ,One thing I wish that would have been done differently is that the people in charge wouldn't just assume we know things or get mad when we don't understand and make us feel stupid for asking questions ,I do not 
"I wanted to join so I could travel, get job experience, and to serve my country ",Only the food portions ,I wish the food portions were bigger,I would say that the food you get here is less then outside of BCT and I think it's caused by exercising more and needing more nutrients,caused by exercising more 
"I joined the army for many reasons to become independent, to help my parents, to go to college and also to travel since I never really had the finances to travel ","I wish we had more personal time to wash out clothes and study things if that nature, it can be stressful having to do things at once especially when you are living with a lot of other girls that want their personal time to wash, shower, study, or relax from the day also I wish we were able to go to the troop store to get things we need","After a long day of exercising and sweating, having about 30 min to do all that can cause be stressful and it's makes the environment stressful because all the people you are living with at the moment want to do a lot of things on their personal time and also I wished the people that make the mistakes get in trouble individually","My platoon makes mistakes so we get our time taken away, that is why I wish the people that make the mistakes get in trouble individually ","Like I said the people that mess up  should get in trouble so others can see and not want to make the same mistake as them because by having us all do it the people that made the mistake don't learn, they think if they mess up the whole platoon we'll get in trouble maybe have them do more physical so they don't want to do the same mistakes "
For my family and my future ,I wish there would be more individual punishments and less group punishments. Specifically for when individuals cause trouble for others in their platoon and don't learn from group punishment.,Some people do not learn well unless directly confronted about there mistakes and how to fix them. Like a one on one tutor in school rather than a teacher for a whole class.,"The individuals who need more work don't get a good incentive to behave and stop getting others in trouble, because they don't care.",Individual counseling or dividing the misbehaving Individuals from those who they are negatively affecting
"I decided to join to serve my state because I wanted to help my community, friends, and family. ",I wish we had harder corrective action when it comes to the troublesome trainees that cause problems. If a certain group is causing issues within a platoon they should be handled separately and differently.,If certain people need discipline or corrective action then they individually should get the corrective actions instead of the entire group,"Trainees being here for the wrong reasons, purposely getting everyone in trouble. If someone wants to be here then they should be able to show and prove they belong here","Corrective action on those individuals instead of the entire group. Anything relating to fratornzation, and bullying should be terminated and therefore booted out"
"I joined because I want to serve my country, on top of that I wanted to make my family proud and hopefully one day be able to take care of them. ","The drill sergeants use Gods name in vain a lot. If that could stop or even slow down that would be great. Also, The hot A's were not that good. ",I would tell them that the food has no seasoning and that the drill seatbelts are always swearing while using Gods name ,I have no clue. Maybe they have no religious or different religious beliefs. Also i don't know what's going on with the food but I feel like it could have some more seasoning ,I think that someone could have a talk with the the drill sergeants to let them know that a lot of people are offended by that and to watch what they say. Also the food can be seasoned or the defac could provide more salt and pepper packets 
I joined because I thought I had too,I didnt have a problem with anything,People did their job correctly and I knew what would happen so I dont think I would change anything ,No
I'm from a military family. But the last family member in the ARMY was my great grandfather. I wanted to stray from what my family did. I've wanted this since I was 6 years old.,"It's just stuff that as a teenage girl, I wish was different. But I know that it is done that way for a reason.","Even if you are not the one doing something wrong and don't always fully know what was done wrong, you will still be disciplined for it.",I do think that specific people should be punished for their mistakes too though.
Hey is Matos ,,,
Well I joined the Army because I was having a lot of bad luck with my life ,Well I think everything its alright the way it is ,I'm in echo company ,Thats all
My parents,Some battle buddies don't like to do things like make their beds so their battle buddies make it for them and when we speak up the whole platoon gets in trouble even if we're in different bays,Everyone gets in trouble for things things their buddies do that they can't control,The people doing the wrong thing should be disciplined individually
To serve my country and purse a military career,"With my families dying from this current virus and considering the virus might effect graduation, I think we should be able to speak to them more",Hearing from our families more than twice a week should be considered,Letting us have our phone more 
I joined to improve myself and my bad habits ,There's nothing that I wish was done differently everything is going ok ,I would say that BCT isn't that bad just prepare yourself physically and mentally , No
"I decided to join because I just graduated high school and I wanted to try the army out because I heard so many good things and somebody from recruiter office called and talk to me so I went to they office and they talk to me and let me pick a job, ",I rush into it I wish I could've had more time because I just got out high school ,Umm I don't know,Making drill sergeants a lil calmer and nicer and I wish we can have better food
Hi,,,
A promise to my best friend,I wish we would have a little more time during pt in the mornings so we have a good workout,Like having another hour or two for working out in the morning instead of just two hours cause once you start to feel a good workout it's over,Maybe putting breakfast earlier
To have a better future and make sure my kids are set up for school,I wish there were had been more hands while in the classroom room,I wish that we had more examples that might happen while we are serving ,
Benefits and a way out of my home town ,Half scoop some of the food and the portions were pretty small ,,
For a different career opportunity ,Nothing,It's hard at first but you need to remember that they are trying to mold you into a soldier from a civilian.,No
2003,Nothing really everything was,Great,No thoughts 
For my family's future and myself ,I truly believe in the abilities of my senior drill sergeant and drill sergeants. ,My senior drill sergeant and my drill sergeants are experts and professionals in what they're doing.,None
To learn a new skill set and be able to travel ,Yellow phase is very boring due to the fact that we are confined to one area ,It's quarantine with PT ,Not sure 
metarie,not getting woken up in the middle of the night,more sleep,not having us bake in the sun
"Wanted to better myself and then found out about the benefits, which added an extra reason",The biggest issue I had with the last two weeks was having so much downtime during the day but not being able to do things like laundry(being that there are 53 of us and only 10 washing machines). Maybe if events were planned closer together so there was more downtime at once or just more at the end of th,Not enough time to wash clothes because the amount of people,Add double stacked washers and dryers 
My sister was sexually abused so I joined to learn how to protect her,I really don't have an answer ,I'm not sure,No
I joined the army to do something better with my life,"Some people get stressed out because it's a sudden change to their previous life, easing into it might be more helpful","BCT is very different, you have less freedom, you are just supposed to do whatever you are told, nothing more nothing less",Drill sergeants take classes on stress maybe
2001,Everything that has transpired in the past two weeks has been a great of training civilians to soldiers ,Well it's great place to be trained and prepared for the military at.,No at the moment 
No problem ! ,"Actually , maybe there should be more of a schedule. I know it's yellow phase but we seemed to have a lot of down time ",,
"College, learning new skills, and serving my country","The brooms are insufficient, as most of them are broken/worn out. There is also nothing to dust with, vinegar would work well for dusting liquid. And some paper towel or reusuable rags would be helpful to clean with ","You will have to clean a lot, and there will be nothing to clean with ",Putting better cleaning materials in the sleeping bags 
To afford college and serve the United States ,I had to spend most of my phone time charging my phone and my cell reception is not good so it takes a while to use my phone ,We only get phones on Sunday so it would be nice to get our phones for longer than 30 minutes maybe 45 minutes ,Charge the phones before we use them or give a couple of minutes to charge phones
Benefits ,First day at reception with no sleep ,The first day at BCT we had no sleep for 24 hours ,To tell drill sergeants to let us sleep  
2002,Wish that we were allowed to do more physical activities and do more team building exercises to be able to work better as a team to make us stronger and not argue as much ,That we got to do more running exercises and we would be able to do more then just the first 100 yards instead of just the one where we just run and put the stuff back where it was because it only is like 25 minutes long so you don't really build that much chemistry to exceed as much as a team ,just give the drill sergeants more stuff to work with 
1999,Actually eating chow in the DEFAC,Instead of eating outside on the ground all the time,I'd like to actually sit down and eat in the cafeteria. It might just be too many people and that's why we eat outside. I don't really know why,Just add more flavor to the food and make a way for all the trainees to eat  somewhere not on the ground
I joined because it was the most logical and assured way to better my future for me and the family i wish to have,"Everything that has happened so far is to expected when trying to manage 500 trainees from varying places and lifestyles. thievery, racism and fighting is unavoidable",I don't actually know how else i could explain that it's really just problems the way the world grew up making people more judgemental or too sensitive to operate in an efficient way ,Set new Social standards that aren't so confined 
Family and for a better life,Such as going into the training faster or implementing more to do,That in the beginning it is slow and kind of boring but it will all be worth it in the end ,Reliving the covid restrictions 
To set up my girlfriend and i for a good future and to be better than my dad ,"It was like school all over again, not a huge fan of being cooped up. Id rather be going on runs and more physical stuff ",The first two weeks of basic training isnt a lot of running and hiking. Its more class driven with PT in the morning. I would have preferred physical activity throughout the day ,No
I joined because I made a promise to my uncle before he passed,That oatmeal was very bland and had no taste,The oatmeal that we eat in the morning has no flavor and needs a little flavor ,Have some spices out to use if wanted
2002,"I wish the switching of platoon didn't happen because during these two week I, build bonds/teammates with the people in my platoon to only learn they aren't gonna be on my team anymore, also yellow phase, I don't like it but I understand why it's a thing ","I would describe it in a teamwork environment way, where u have teammates and grow together as a team; and the yellow phase is about it being boring, but it's don't because of covid","Nope, just letting the covid virus decrease over time"
I decided to join the army for my family and to help me in my future career ,One thing that I would have liked better is to have updated blue books and other supplies instead if the being out dated,"We should have up to date books, so we can study the right knowledge ","I think the books are out dated because the army is always changing and adding more rules and safety things, also new technology comes out every year","Im not sure, maybe trying to update the books more often "
Respect and benefits ,An provide them as well,And,"Asking, who is missing supplies once they arrive to bct"
I joined because I like the Comradery in the Army,"So after last formation, I wish I could go downstairs and utilize the pullup bars",I wish I could use the pullup bars during personal time,I think thedrill sergeant just needs to allow trainees to use it  
"I don't really anymore, kinda just here for the ride for now atleast but before was to have a better start in life","No, I can't ",I don't know,Nope
to set up a career and solidify mine and my kids future.,"dont really mean it, i have no second thoughts nor do i have regrets about joining the army. i am content and at peace with my decision.",be sure of what you wanna do and just know what you want in life at all times.,keep doing the same thing i've been doing
To set myself up for the future,There is a lot of sitting around going on and it seems like this two weeks is for for the drill sergeants to smoke us everyday rather than learn important skills ,These two weeks if yellow phase has a lot of sitting around and waiting rather than getting right into training and that kinda sucks,Where this week is used for quarantine there is limited things we can do I assume but I do thing we could do more this week instead of just waiting for red phase to start ,Start red phase sooner and shorten the yellow phase
The generations behind me did the same MOS so I thought I'd keep it going and to also take my mother to Italy like she dreamed ,"Maybe a few more stretches before the 1 mile assessments unless you dont get to do that in the acpft, then just keep doing what yall are doing","I think it would make sense either way but if I had to reword it, I'd say a little warm up before a physical test",Maybe just to prepare yourself because you can't always be prepared to do hard exercises. So the people who do take the test is just to prep them for the future? Just a guess.,"Maybe just some certain types of foods for the next day of PT? Like if we're running before breakfast, we should have something more fueling and not make us constipated."
For the benefits ,I think everything is fine and nothing is bad,,
Because I want to become a better man and contribute to this country ,Yes,Bct is fun,Not at all
To serve the country and make something out of myself ,Improved on my physical ability before I came to basic training ,Got more physically fit before I came here to basic,No I do not
"I joined for many reasons, to learn about life, to meet people, and to learn combat",More explanation about customs and courtesies ,Customs and courtesies is annoying ,Put it into the blue book or have a poster up explaining it
To hopefully get a career using what I learn here in the real world ,Echo,On what ,This didn't even ask me a question I don't even know how to answer this
My mom wasn't working so I needed a way to pay for college,"Communication to home, the letters are slow and inefficient in our modern age and the 30 minutes of phone time feels desperate, emails would almost be better if you still want to cut people off from home and have them focus on training. Just allow people to connect with their families better and the experience will be much less devastating and depressing.","The home-to-training communication is awful and only makes trainees more depressed and more likely to want to leave or perform other drastic actions. This isn't WWII anymore, this is 2021.","Yes, allow a method to send letters via email/internet, potentially use a copier to scan the letter and send it in mornings instead of putting it in a mailbox, save on money and time and make trainees happier"
"Father was special forces, and inspired me to join for the brotherhood and discipline, as well as the many benefits the Army can provide.","I wish we had stuff to do during the day rather then just sitting , yellow phase has just been sitting studying and pt, nothing like I thought basic was supposed to be",The first two weeks of basic training are sitting around reading a paper or working out and it's boring and isn't what I thought basic training to be,"Yellow phase, it's quarantine for a disease where you have to sit and do nothing and wear masks in heat cat 5, when alot of people already have had it or already are vaccinated","Remove yellow phase and go straight into red phase like before covid, and remove the forced masks"
"Manassas, VA",3-34th,More things to do. It was extremely boring.,Covid. Yellow phase sucks
I was born in 1986 in Sarh in Chad 🇹🇩 in Africa ,Feeding is not as good as I was thinking ,A lot of MRE and not good enough like at the processing cafeteria ,I'm not going to tell the things that are happening in BCT outside because Things that happen in BCT stay in BCT. That's my principle ,The big factor I think is COVID-19 
2002, Like the bottom of the beds got mold and the phone don't work dust and dirt all behind the dryer ,The mattress on the beds have mold on them also upon arriving there is tin or dust and dirt on the floor behind the washers and dryers ,Proper cleaning of each mattress between cycles and better cooks because we sweat and our body releases salt and we are not able to replace it 
"Money, opportunity, to see the world and to leave my neighborhood",The portions that are given are some what meager and I am usually still hungry ,The intense exercise makes you hungry but tou don't get that much food,More reflection time as well and I'm not sure
I joined to serve my country and pay for college in order to become an officer in order to better serve it,"Yes, the food needs to be improved so that it is remotely edible, the food while being nutritious is awful and hard on the stomach ",Need better food ,Maybe better train the cooks?
To help me further my education,We get less phone time,Hard,Bye
To learn a skill that the need for would never go away in the civilian world,Eggs have no flavor and there is no salt to put on them,More salt,Provide more salt and pepper
2003,I'm in Echo company ,I wish the training would be better in terms of more sleep maybe because our bodies don't have fully enough time to heal and recover and for a lot of people it's there first tea experience of doing anything actual physical ,The drill sergeants Nick picking at every single little thing that half of the people don't know what to do or how to do it or what it is but I understand that that's apart of there job ,No 
"I joined for the betterment of myself, my family, and my future.",Been more proactive with my battle buddies and talk with them more about unferstanding the situation that we're all being put in together.,That being cooperative in a general sense helps you understand and deal with certain things in life a lot easier.,By being more proactive and conversing with my battle buddies more often.
,,,
"To travel, get more physically fit, and to not pay a lot for college","More protein in our meals, specific thing me to do certain personal tasks. ",Certain meals don't contain much protein and there is usually not enough time to do laundry or brush teeth due to everyone using the machines,Making the platoons smaller so that individuals who require help are helped and not ignored
"I have always wanted to be in the army since I was very young, I didn't see myself going to college any time soon and I have family who are prior service so I enlisted in the army to give myself an early start in life. ",No. There is nothing that I have done or have not done that I wish I did differently. ,I do not wish I did anything differently. ,I can Keep not making major mistakes. 
To make my family proud of me,I personally don't have any problems with the way things have gone so far,I would explain BCT as a way to strengthen the mind and body in a way that gives you a soldier's mentality ,No not really 
To protect and serve my country ,Like on what will happen after basic training ,I wouldn't be able to ,Tell somebody to answer my questions 
2002,On my phone,Music is a great way to improve yours and everyone's mode overall,Or something like that
I joint the national guard to pay for my children's college in the future. ,"Some days little to no protein with the meals that we have to eat while sitting on the concrete for them all, and no electrolytes to supplement losing water from the South Carolina summer. But other than that the training is easier than o expected ",We ate non nutritious food on a concrete slab multiple times a day with no electrolyte or sodium' supplement to replenish what we're losing out of our bodies ,Offering the proper nutrition to help supplement the loss of fluids in a body 
I didn't know what to do in college and military looked cool,Sometimes there is too little portion of food for some people,Some people get more food than others,Not sure 
Indiana ,Come in prepared,Don't really know what I'm doing really just going with the flow,Like come in ready don't come in blind and not knowing what you're going to do and I think just aniexty  and the way I live my life,Not really probably going to continue doing it
1998,I wish I were to be in better physical shape. ,"To get into a better mental, physical, and more disciplined state of mind before leaving for basic training",Shipout 
"Well mainly because it was a last minute decision, I really didn't have a reason other than the job was open and I felt pressure to join right then ",I wish I would have prepared myself more for the separation anxiety ,"I would tell them to talk to their friends and family as much as they can, then out of nowhere just stop, and that's what it feels like ",Allowing trainees to have their phone during person time 
Didn't want to go to college,I barely have time for things like laundry and showers,Everything is rushed,Early time to head to the bay after dinner
It gave me some sort of course,Yes,Don't do it,Send me home.
Money ,,,
Career opportunities ,,,
I joined cause I have family who are/were past military and I also wanted to serve my country,Like working on the leg tucks and the standing power throw ,Just working on it before are first acft ,Scheduling it into the day
The experience and the mos I was offered,One person can mess up and then the whole platoon has to do corrective training instead of that one person and during yellow phase we don't do any team things yet where we actually mess up as a group ,The group will receive punishment for one persons mistake instead of the groups mistake ,Perform corrective training individually until red phase
I love American ,"We smell like butt, need more shower breaks",We stink and need showers more,Showers 
I joined for money and travel ,We get 10 minutes to use the latrine and other things with 50+ males and only like 10 stalls ,Everything is rushed ,Give us a little more time to do our hygiene and bathroom breaks
I wanted to learn a specialized skill ,The army dynamic warm ups are a good start but I need more time to fully stretch certain muscles to avoid injuries ,I would appreciate more time to allow for my muscles to be fully stretched before running so as to not get injured and static muscles stretches are important for that ,I do not have any thoughts on improving this 
College,Nothing,I'd say that I wouldn't change anything,No
To have a guaranteed pay check,To jump straight into physical training ,"BCT has a phase that is meant for quarantine (yellow phase) which is slow pace, I'm aware it is necessary to have that phase but that is one thing I wish that did not exist","Improve better hygiene within the bays such as enforcing better hygiene to the trainees, give the trainees more hygiene products and a more spacious living area. "
I've joined to travel ,Most of the food was served outside and so there would be bugs on the food which makes it un eatable ,"Food is set on a table outside, your served outside ",Placing more building for the dfac 
"It just seemed like the most obvious choice. Free college, fun experiences, stable and almost assured career path etc.","Like there have been times when I called attention, the company commander told me not to, and when I didn't do it next time in that same scenario a drill sergeant got angry with me","You're told to do something, you do it, someone in a higher position tells you not to do it, you listen to the person in a higher position, and then the person in a lower position yells at you",Establish a set system that ensures everyone is on the same page
Yes you can ask why I joined the army ,Running is very hard for me and I wish I could of practiced more on running longer and take less breaks ,Prepare for running ,No 
Brunswick Maine,Echo ,I wish I had learned more about the training process and how annoying it would be ,Don't wake the trainees up with screaming and yelling and have them do corrective training 
08/06/2003,Echo,Uhh,It's basic training 
For the service to my country and to travel,They would conduct corrective training for actions taken or not taken when we were not taught how to conduct the proper action,We got punished for something we weren't taught how to do,More time devoted to teaching in the first weeks instead of corrective training
Yepper,Echo,E,Otherwise everything else is alright
I didn't know what to do after high school didn't want to do medical so I chose a job I could use after my time here ,Cross leg on concrete hurts my tail bone/ lower back and the tire pit feels like it's cutting through my skin when we kneel and I'm a religious guy so I can't eat certain things,The ground is hard the tire In the square we workout in is sharp or at least so it feels and I can't eat pork amount other things so far only once I couldn't eat the meat ,Maybe grass instead but that would cause the people to have to cut the grass unless it's turf
To have a better future ,I would like to get straight into the fun stuff and hate taking test,I would like to do physical stuff early than what it is,Make the COVID-19 shot mandatory 
2003,Some trainees couldnt follow some directions and we got corrective training because of it,If you or your team messes up/doesnt follow directions; they'll correct you with push ups or other eexersices,Maybe punish everyone but then make only distruptive trainees have more corrective training. To make it more fair on why 2 trainees messed it up for all 54 of us.
,,,
Boredom ,Going to fail if I can't do a leg tuck,Do more pull up,It is
,,,
2003,I wish nothing was done differently ,BCT was exactly what you would expect it's tiring and constant working out,No
For the gi bill,I would have done nothing differently ,We haven't really done anything these three weeks ,No
For college ,It was a bit unorganized at the beginning ,It was rough ,No
To start my career and life,"There are three toilets that don't work in the 2nd bay bathroom, 5 showers that don't work, and I'm constantly hungry because it's an uneven ration between how much we eat and work out","The plumbing sucks, and there isn't a lot of food to go around",Fix the plumbing and get us more food
I honestly wanted to join to better myself and help serve my community and to also get in shape better.,I personally feel if we were able to use our personal shoes from the start it would have benefited many people here. And i dont really have any complaints otherwise its bct it isnt suppose to be easy and like being at home.,Its a very beneficial place to go and be at. That being said prepare accordingly. Prepare to run and tak care of yourself like a adult,I have been very stressed more about being here and maintaining my legs due to shin splints stress is high due to not having ran properly on pavement before. Stress is high but that is expected,I have been properly icing and rolling my shins to help and just focusing on pushing through it
I joined to give my girlfriend and I a life to live and help out my mom,I wish I would've helped out more people on sweeping the bays,I would tell people that working with your buddies is the key to success,To start working with my buddies more and ensure my buddies work with eachother
To serve something bigger than myself,I cant think of anything,That i cant think of anything to complain about,Nope
"It was the best career choice for me, i wanted to travel, and i had lots of support from friends and family to join the Army.",Like when we are cleaning the bay or in our formation or doing physical training.,"Basically just making sure everyone is doing what they are suposed to do, and speak up when you see someone doing something wrong.","Just get along more and listen, or have drill sergeants give a briefing about it."
I saw it as a potential career path,I think how it is right now is perfectly fine with covid still going on and what not,Basic training will change and to not expect anything but mentally prepare yourself ,None
Honestly I don't know at,No I'm good,I would only say describe or discuss it with my Wife,Yes but I rather keep them to myself 
To protect and serve this country ,More personal time,Not enough free time,No
I didn't wanna go to college and I love my country and I got a trade and good benefits ,We only get 30 minutes or less of phone time and people with separated or larger family's it makes it hard to talk to them,Getting your whole life taken but you know it's there you are just separated from your loved ones,More phone time
"I love the army, my dad was in, my uncle was in, and my grandfather was in. I care about the army values and responsibilities we have as soldiers.",I wish there was more indivitual correctional training because I have been punished countless times over the 2 weeks due to my battle buddys and I cant make them follow orders.,If my brother gets in touble I also get in trouble even if i wasnt even there for the mistake.,Drill seargants dont take my time or mess up my perfectly made hospital corners because my battlebuddys refuse to get into formation on time.
Because I wanted to do some dangerous things and also to finish school,,,
College and career experience,I don't have any suggestions,I would not suggest anybody to join and do BCT if they are not really mentally and physically prepared because this is hard,No
To get away from NY,It seamed rushed and required alot of time to process everything that was being stated,The introduction to the new company and area was very quick very little time to internalize any information,Taking a time to get the intro out so it can be processed
To serve my country ,,,
College pay and to follow my families foot steps,"Well like all of it feels normal to me, wake up and workout, chow then get the day started ","We wake up at 5am, workout for 1hr, eat breakfast, do classes and training till 12, eat lunch, more training, dinner at 5pm, then closing ceremony at 7 and then bed at 8 pm",Nope
"To improve myself, travel, and make money",Wish could eat more to put on more to bulk up by the end of BCT,I'm trying to gain weight in BCT and turn it into muscle ,Automatically put people we is under a program or to eat more food while I'm here
I joined so that my family could look at me and be proud ,Like on Wednesday getting my phone to call my family ,Your very limited to your phone and the outside world you can't understand how it is until your in the situation ,No
Mostly as a way to start my future with good bearing.,"Since yellow phase was a big deal, we had to get chow delivered. As a result the menu options were heavily restricted. By result people with dietary restrictions had a hard time adjusting to the lack of varying nutrients.",Don't come to BCT as a vegetarian because they won't cater towards your restriction.,Maybe incorporate pre-packaged meals into breakfast and lunch chow. Besides MRE's of-course. Atleast for yellow phase vegetarian trainees.
So that my future family will have a better life than I had growing up,I forgot to get her address and i don't know how to get her address to send her letters,Get every address of anyone you would want to send mail to,No
I didn't want a boring life and I also want to be able to care for my younger sisters,"Most things have been decent, for basic training standards anyways. Hostile environments and tension in the air could be worked on ",Hostile environments can be an issue sometimes among trainees and even drill sergeants ,
My family was in the army and the lifelong benefits ,I ask to many questions ,You just need to shut the fuck up,Stop asking questions 
Family tradition,Thank you,Get directly into training instead of wasting time,
College and it seems like a good career path,Pull ups,Don't cheat yourself and apply yourself ,
"Family tradition and to serve for God, Family and my country ",I am not like myself at home and I try better than ever before,That BCT will make you more disciplined and make you a better person,To do better each day
College ,All of them where challenging ,I work out and practice drills all day,Nope
I joined because I wanted to doing something meaningful and cool in my life and help take care of my family and future ,I really don't enjoyed PT in the morning and the classroom sessions to gain knowledge before we start doing a lot more training ,"It's a lot like a college team. You workout in the morning, go to class, and workout later in the day",
To help my mother get her green card,Moving fast,There will be times where you won't have time to think,Be ready and focus harder
College and to set myself up for a better life,I wish we were a little more prepared for when things kick off this next week,I wish we did more at first to prepare us for when things get more hectic,Not really
"College financial help, travel, prior family military service ",The punishments for specific things could be more compartmentalized instead of everyone getting punished especially if platoon members are fighting ,Punishments for specific situations should only be punishing the people involved and not the whole platoon,Not sure exactly but a way could be to separate the people who are fighting in the first place
"To secure a future, which included Getting Naturalization and getting benefits for college, and lastly Serving The United States. ",I have gain a Growth mindset and I have become more disciplined than I was before joining ,Valuing the process of life staying positive and obeying orders given. ,Staying motivated and keep pushing through. 
Cuz I wanted to,No,It isn't as hard as you would think,Give us more food
Help pay for college and set up my future in the army,My rank/pay grade is not correct as I should be a e3 but all my paperwork says e1,I'm not getting paid right,No
For personal pride and to prove I'm capable of being more,I needed to exercise more and get used to to hard work sooner,Harder work sooner makes for an easier time now,Work harder and keep pushing myself
Great career and to better my life ,Only three drill Sargents are assigned to my platoon I don't feel like it is enough to watch over 30 plus trainees,Only three drill Sargents watch over our platoon. So we need more to watch over us when one or two may be gone,Not sure
To help build a life for myself and fiancée and to get experience so I can become a state trooper ,I think everything has been done appropriately and in the right order ,It's what has been described since before coming here ,There's no being rude or cruel 
I wanted to come to the army to learn wheeled mechanics and better myself and set a good example for my younger siblings ,Everything has been organized really good ,The times that we wake up and eat are at good times and we get good breaks in the shade,No
to better my life and provide for my future family,nothing crazy has really happened. basic is how it's supposed to be,"dont be scared of joining. its basic, so dont think that these people are here to be your friend. they have one job, to transition you from civilian ti solider life",no
2003,I can't think of anything that could have been done differently ,Basic training has been what I expected and I wouldn't change anything ,Not really 
I joined to get my parents legal status changed ,Not enough people from the bays speak up on what's going on so the drill sergeants don't know certain problems that are going on with other trainees,There's a lot of drama with the females and nothing really gets resolved with the drill sergeants because no one wants to be a snitch ,Have all female trainees go to the classroom and write slips on situations they want fixed 
I decided to join to further my education and also because a lot of my family is military ,Just better communication within platoons and drill sergeants with trainees,Just better communication skills making sure everyone is on the same page so that way for us trainees were more prepared ,By talking more and making sure everyone is on the same page
To better myself ,I wish I did more exercises prior to shipping here for training. The physical training we do here is very strenuous. Not impossible but it would've been easier if I had did some work prior. ,I would say practice upper body and core workouts,No
Benefits,Nothing can be done differently ,BCT is organized ,No
"I joined for the VA loan, and the education benefits. ","Well, the bay I reside in hasn't been working so they installed temporary AC units, but the bay still has room temperatures of 77-80 degrees. The drill sergeants do their best to make it cooler, but it's still hot at night. ",I wish the AC units in the rooms would function better. ,Maybe having different people work on the AC units to fix it. 
I'm not 100% sure yet ,I don't think enough happened for me to want to change anything ,I would want them to train more ,No
"I decided to join army for my college benefits, for my family and wanted to do something for my country. ",They are making us do our work on time and making us used to this environment which is completely different from my civilian life.. I don't think there is anything that needs to be changed or done differently ,"I would say that the life here is totally different from what it is outside and I think it's really good to have the life we have in here, disciplined, everything on time, respect, teamwork .. ",Not really .. I don't have anything that I can put on this 
For the benefits and to help with schooling ,The separation of females and males between the platoons. Due to the COVID guidelines. Because when we then intergrade into our actual platoon we will be behind. ,That there is different phases here at BCT and that due to COVID there was a delay into transferring into the first actual first phase which is red phase ,Just taking the proper and appropriate steps for covid. Also with covid testing 
I joined for college purposes and it's honestly what I've always wanted to do,I hope we can hold Not be  getting punished for peoples actions even when you've tried to correct them but they are being hard headed. ,Can not *,"And making sure trainees know that they are responsible for their actions.  Not bringing to whole team down. Like if they mess up, they have to get punished, not everyone especially when we have told them not to "
college benefits and to support my family,so we get to keep our phones but only take them out at night during our personal time ,i would just describe to them that we won't know when we get our next phone call but that i wish i could call home at night,i'm not 100% sure but i think maybe if we talked to the high chain of command and explained to them maybe they would understand 
College Tuition and Family,I wish we had integrated with our respective platoons earlier so that we could learn and get to know our battle buddies/learn the regulations of our platoons.,Because of COVID-19 we were stuck in a 5th platoon/group of all females so that we would stay separated/quarantined.  After quarantine is done then we integrated with our actual platoon/group.,No
I joined because tuition benefits ,Like I was expecting more stuff like yelling and screaming I was ready prepare ,Some of my friends that was in basic training was telling that it is hard and that the run a lot they don't eat enough and they don't sleep enough so I have prepare myself by starting running 2 weeks before my shipment and less sleep ,No
Nope,"More personal time because we only have an hour to do laundry, personal hygiene, and exercise but there are a lot of other people who want to do the same things so not everyone gets to do and yeah",Don't join and you won't have to worry--- we only have 1 hour to ourselves to do multiple things and not everyone gets to do it,I don't have any
The tuition and benefits ,I don't wish anything to change because I can't do anything anyways,I'm getting discharged so no reason for me to continue ,Go home and check what I need to rejoin.
To serve my country and to start a financial plan so my family has one less kid to worry about ,I knew it was going to be hard work and there would be a lot of stress but the drill sergeants make sure we understand why we do something ,I would tell them that it's going to be hard but in the end it is good for you and the drill sergeants are doing their jobs to make sure we become good soldiers ,Make sure that all trainees are able to hear and see explanations 
for benefits ,basically got more in shape & strengthening my core more ,"I would tell them to focus on cardio, endurance & their core ",just exercising on my own 
I decided to join the Army to pay for cosmetology school and gain more self independence.,We working on our push ups and sit ups.  But I also know we had to adapt to the humidity here. ,I would describe it to someone who isn't in BCT by saying working on your physical weakness for example push ups or sit-ups can be difficult if you are not adapted to the climate/humidity. But that shouldn't stop you. Because you can do exercise outside for 15 minutes and do 15 minutes in the house. And alternate back and fourth.,What causing it is. That some people who aren't from here wouldn't be adapted to our climate/humidity in a day. It takes a while to be fully adapted and if you aren't it can cause serious injuries. ,I would say having more time to fill out camel backs and more water breaks. And we can also go outside more but take breaks to cool off.
I wanted to start a life for myself and my boyfriend. I also realized that the benefits are worth the work. And I would like to go to college for free.,"In Yellow Phase, (Quarantine) we train but the exercise needs to be explained more throughly. Also, having kettle bells and deadlift weights Day 0 would have helped me so much.",Explain exercises better and have weights in the room from Day 0.,The Weights are placed in a storage container. So have some Cadre or Trainees clean/sanitize the weights and bring them up to the rooms before Day 1. Drill Sergeants explain each exercise for 2 days instead of 1 to make sure each trainee is doing it properly. is how I would improve it.
Benefits & wanting to be apart of something big,"So I am flat footed as in I have no arch support in my feet. But 120th issued me the wrong pt shoes for people who have perfectly arched feet. So when they moved me to BC ... the more I had walked the more the pain in my feet was getting worse. So finally they issued me the right shoes, but now I'm still in pain & im doing exercises to heal.",If you are flat footed please make it your mission for 120th to issue you the right shoes & do not let them tell you what to get for your feet.,Getting the right shoes & stop issuing the wrong shoes. No one wants to do BT uncomfortable.
My parents were both in the military I decided to follow their path since the education and health benefits ,So COVID-19 caused for the girls to be separated from the boys. Because of this while I know the girls of the platoon really well but I know nothing about the boys which may make it difficult to work with some of them since I don't understand their backgrounds so things they say may be taken differently from by me so we could have miscommunication which would make teamwork difficult,There may be miscommunication between members of a team since they hardly know each other,It can be fixed by ensuring people are vaccinated to lessen the possibility of COVID-19 going through the company. The way it could be improved and fixed would be to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations to those who can safely have it so the company will have herd immunity 
Financial support ,I wish we ran more rather than doing so many core workouts and push up and stuff like that ,I wish we ran more rather than doing so many core workouts and push up and stuff like that ,No
Yes,Instead of waiting to integrate due to COVID it would've been easier to integrate males and females training so that it would not have felt like some trainees are falling behind.,"I think that there should be no yellow phase and we should get straight into red, or if there is a yellow phase and there's a whole separate platoon for the females it should stay like that so there's no moving and switching what Group you're put into training with.","Yes, being less strict on COVID restrictions "
For stability and too further my education ,It's hard to explain ,Communication as in being hard to approach without seeming annoyed n making sense when giving direction for example they say when need to correct our battle buddies and when we do they yell in say it doesn't require talking,Punished 
To join the army band and persue my career in music performance ,"Leadership skills, Running.",I wish I found out that I needed to working on my leadership skills and my performance with running sooner.,Asking for advice when it comes to leading. As for the running issue I may just need different shoes.
College money,I don't think anything can be improved,"I wouldn't, because I said nothing",No
For school and to better myself ,I miss my family ,We only get our phones for anoint an hour every Sunday and I wish we had more time to talk to our family ,Either giving more phone time on Sunday or do a second day with our phones
College money,Certain lessons or events that would be done each day,Daily tasks on what you will be completing each day,Making a planned schedule 
For financial stability for myself and future family and help others that can't help them selves,Most cardio stretches before engaging cardio,Take your time and make sure you get in a good stretch before engaging any activity ,Continue with very deep stretches and make the stretching process longer than usual so you can get in the stretches 
"I joined for the benefits, to make my family proud, and to travel as well as gain a variety of marketable skills ",I wish we could have practiced more on our team building skills and do some character building classes to get everyone on track and build chemistry between the whole platoon.,I would describe it to someone outside of BCT as a team building exercise that brings everyone closer together so we can work better as a team and we all strive to work going the same direction.,The character classes should do the job!
Family Heritage and to take care of my family ,"I've always been a hands on person, so being in the classroom all day really sucked plus it gave me time to sit and think which isn't good the first few days for new recruits ",New recruits always want to go home. So giving them time to sit and think about home doesn't help them adjust the to the army life style ,I think you guys are doing pretty good with it 
"To secure a bright future for myself, Serve my country, and make my family proud",At final formation the Drill Sergeant would use a megaphone to talk but would face away from most of the trainees. This made it very hard to hear and understand important information.,At the end of the day the drill sergeant was very hard to understand when giving us instructions because he was using a megaphone and facing away from us,The Drill Sergeants at the reception battalion have a very repetitive and daunting job which could cause them to not care as much about their job or become bored/disgruntled ,Having a more defined schedule and more effective means to get information to both Drill Sergeants and trainees at the reception battalion 
Financial stability and secure future for my self and future family ,Ive never been the person to take weight lifting and stretching seriously and I'm trying to change that but I don't know how ,Honestly the way I put it. I like to workout and improve my strength but I have a hard time being motivated,Just self improvement Honestly 
"college, benefits, self improvement ",The senior drill sergeant put in an emergency work order to fix the water temperature from but it hasn't been fixed even though people have come to work on it,"water too hot = bad 
water too cold = bad
water not too hot and not too cold = good",call plumbers
Education ,The difference between parade rest and at ease and when to use them ,When to stand in certain positions ,Using different positions when waiting for certain things. Sometimes it switches back and forth between parade rest and attention when waiting for the same thing ,More teaching and elaborating on it in the first days at BCT
I wanted to better myself as a person and support my future family ,Except the air conditioning ,It's hot in the bays,Get air conditioning guys to come out and fix it
Financial stability and to take care of my family,It's been a fairly smooth process. It's gone as well as you would expect,The drill Sargents keep things moving at a good pace and keep situations under control. Every day is well planned and well executed ,No
"I decided to join for the money stability, travel, and job  experience",We have done qlot of paperwork and classroom learning. And instead of that i would rather be out and about doing the stuff,The first 2 weeks are alot of paperwork and its kinda dissapointing,If i were to guess its so that we dont put any of the other trainees in danger and so you can reqch out to people who learn better in different ways,Not that i can think of
Financially stability and collage ,I don't have any problems with the training ,The training is good and it gets you in shape physically and also makes you mentally discipline ,No not right now 
To support my family the most my 3 sisters,"Although we are doing ok, when it comes to showing discipline, some of trainees just can't keep quiet or Stand in the position of attention",It is a new life and really is a great experience to become a soldier,I really wish that we all can agree with each other and hope we can try better for tomorrow
I decided to join for college and to prove to myself that I can do anything I put my mind to.,"Training for me has went great, nothing to really improve on ",My basic training experience so far has been pretty good,
The values and knowledge I will gain here will help me achieve my bigger goals in life.,"Even though the meals have been accommodating to vegetarians,non beef or pork eaters, I feel as if it's a lack of knowledge of the different types of dietary restrictions such as vegans etc..","In BCT coming in as a vegetarian, or a person with dietary restrictions it could be difficult deciphering what food you can and cannot eat due to non labeling and some staff lack of knowledge of what can supplement the nutrients you may miss when non eating  the same as everyone else.",More research and awareness of the many different dietary restrictions that many may have and adjust to the number of recruits with such dietary restrictions.
This is my only way to build a good life,Somethings we did felt like it took longer than it shouldve,Lots of waiting,No
Both my mom & dad join & I think it is good for long time goals,I think everything was right. Do what you are told to do & I tried my hardest on everything.,Hard work & yelling ,Nothing I think the ds are doing what needs to be done
For college money and citizenship,We need to do more running ,Alot of running improves your body physical fitness,No
College and to help my mother,"I mean the schedule of the day

I wish we could understand what we were attempting to do more at times ","I would explain it by saying that

Sometimes there is a lack of purpose in what we do, and I feel it isnr planned out",
To build a foundation,"No, I can't think of one thing that had been done differently.",Over the last 2 weeks,Improving what exactly?
Alot of different reasons ranging from pride to personal gain,They usually are each doing similar thing but in their own way or just not on the same schedule,They aren't on the same page alot,Have them make like a weekly plan on Sunday or something
To provide for my spouse and my future family,When some drill sergeants tell you where to go they yell and most the time things get miscommunicated,Pay attention very close to what drill sergeants has to say,Fix the speakers so things can be heard clearly
I joined because of family tradition and to better myself,We were in the bay either doing maintenance or sitting around till chow or class time. It took up a good amount of time of every day,We were either sitting around or cleaning when we were not in the class or eating ,No 
I decided to join because I wanted to do something better with my life,Yes,It's not a bad time you meet some great people and make friends and learn to become a soldier,No
Money,It was a solid block of tomato sauce,You have to eat cold Mac and cheese right in front of a working microwave,A microwave
"Yes, I decided to join the Army to be a part of something great, and to be the best ""me"".","In my opinion everything was done as well it could have been conducted, the only thing I wish we could have done different is the required mask, but with covid-19 still on the loose it would be unsafe to do so.",Masks suck and so does disease but I guess we need one to help stop the other.,Keep wearing masks would probably keep transmission rates down
My uncle served in Vietnam and I wanted to start a career in aviation ,Better timing ,The waiting,No
Berea Ohio,Every company had done dings wrong bc we don't know what to do but we all did get down and do push ups and all but it was well deserved. We also have plenty of activities to do wether it would be workouts or running the track. We also get weights in our bay to help us prepare for the test. And everyone knows what they need to get on there test to pass and I try my best to get what I need to get done.,"As long as you listen, do as your are told, and work for your goals in your free time then you will be successful",While in the bay I personally can talk to them and help them understand what to do to get through
For school ,The first 2 week been good,The first 2 week nothing interesting happen. We started to learn about the army and the company leaders,No
For the benefits,No the training was fine I learned a lot,It's hard but remember why you joined ,No
To pay for college,"In first platoon, we were put away for the rest of the company so we were usually running back and forth between delta and Charlie company. ",Be ready to run ,No
It would set me up for later in life,Instead of all of Charlie staying in one barracks my platoon had to move to a different building for yellow phase,They split us up into a different building away from the rest of the company ,Not sure 
2003,I wish that the stuff we received would've been more organized and less we were carrying 6 bags at a time and there was people who couldn't do that ,Pack light don't bring a budged hygiene stuff and lots of clothes bring one change of clothes and the important hygiene stuff and leave it at that ,I think it's the lack of communication of what you really need to bring to basic and what is given to you. And the fact that you get 3 to 5 bags you have to carry ,Make the info about what you receive at BCT more open and also teach trainees how to pack the items they received better 
Money and football ,A lot of things were switched last minute or not firm on what to do ,I would say always keep your guard up and don't get comfortable ,Organization 
I wanted to become more disciplined and have college money,Getting ice tubs to cool down on a regular it's really hot ,It's hot and I want an ice bath to cool off,Build more shady areas 
I joined the Utah army national guard for my family. And In case my kids ever join the military i wanted to be able to help them with my exsperiences.,Theres paper work and hurry up and wait and all that. Just boring and tediouse. Dealing with all the high school age and type kids kinda sucks but thats because im 30.,I frel like that would eork out side of basic training. ,Not really. Maybe set bays up by age. But that would kinda go against EO
Family reasons,Starting to go through some of the different obstacles courses to help build platoon strength ,Having platoons going through basic obstacles courses to build teamwork ,The pandemic has a effect on the things that we can and can't do during the first two weeks. So it begins to feel like we just sit around and not do a whole lot,I believe the best way to fix this is to have a quarantine period during reception and then when trainees get to the company basic training starts like normal
To get a better job than landscaping to improve the lives of my wife and i,"They cause chafing, acne, make your eyes more tired when the hot air is released etc",It already should,No
Get a good job that will make me money,We wernt allowed much sleep at the 120th and it would have been better if I could have gotten more sleep at the 120th,You are not allowed to get much sleep during procesing at the 120th ,Let there be more allowed sleeping time
Benefits and College,More difinitive schedules,Things change all the time,No
Always wanted to due to the respect I have had and wanted to earn the same respect ,It's a lot of sitting not doing much waiting and anticipating red phase. There are some days that are fine then others that we sit and do nothing,Just a lot of sitting and waiting not much trying ,"No, not really it's just two weeks. It's sucks but what can you do about it with Covid 
"
2003,Everything was slow moving at a slow pace and we didn't get into any real action yet,Boring ,No not really 
I joined to help me become more stable after highschool and to get benefits ,Nothing,In Basic training you have to be very physical ,No everything is great
"Just wanted to get as much done while I'm young, and ultimately for the health and education benefits ",I think all went pretty well nothing was really inconvenient ,All directions and overall guidance from the military/civilian staff members were clear and comprehensive ,Nope
To Get away from the bad things in my town,It felt like at times we didn't know what would come next instead of telling us this is what's happening through out the day, We didn't have a day plan of what was going on it was mostly hour by hour,At final formation or dinner chow we are told what to prepare our selves for in the coming day
For the benefits of having college paid for and to have a job rather than sitting around doing nothing.,"Drill sergeants often times don't give enough time to complete the tasks we are given. The tasks given to us often take longer than what they give us such as cleaning the entire bay, sweeping, cleaning the bathrooms in 10 mins. Just wish we were given more time to complete our day to day duties.",Honestly I wouldnt describe it any other way than that.,Spread the activities for the week evenly amongst the week. Make each day even and have equal amounts of tasks so one doesnt get overwhelmed like many of us are.
For college benefits ,I wish our platoon didnt get split up and go into 2 different bays when yellow phase ends because we just got adjusted to the bay we were in and the people in our platoon ,The company was in a quarentine with each other and my platoon went to a different company but when it ended we back to our company and got split up to fit in the company barracks ,No
For the benefits,Get the benefits for college.,"After bct, if you want to get more skill in the mos, go to college ","After AIT, go to schooling for more skill"
College,That we turn our rifles in daily instead of only once ,That is hell but It can be fun ,Make a giant 10 mile dome over fort jackson and ac the entire place 
To set a good example,My battle buddy/friend from hawaii that i came here with is in 2nd platoon ,I got separated from my friend in reception,No
To have college benefits,To pay close attention closely to drill sergeants order.,Always stay cautious of any orders that is given to you. And never let your guard down,Make better friendly contact with them to reason out the situation 
My high school grades were too bad to get into college so I planned to use having military service on my resume to help me with college,"Well what with how hot South Carolina gets, and how briefs can tend to range from 10-45 minutes sitting out in the sun that whole time isn't the most pleasurable. It is the Army though, so...",More shade.,More. Shade.
I have always wanted to join the military and I wanted to start a mechanics career and college isn't for me ,That's the company I'm with I really wish I had done more working out and physical training before I came here because I have been struggling with a few things physically and mentally ,To really prepare yourself because it's going to smack you in the face ,Ive never been away from home before and i miss home and things I used to do plus I didn't work out much before I came and I'm regretting not preparing more,Put in 100% every day and hope everything will improve plus hopefully being busy will help with homesickness 
I wanted to get away and start my life off to a good start ,"I wish I would've learned the soldiers creed, army song, etc a little sooner ",I would say it's helpful to learn the things you're going to learn at basic prior to coming so that it's easier ,"I think what's causing it is that the process of learning is slower when trainees aren't familiar with the information prior to coming, where as if trainees knew a little bit of information the learning process would be much faster and you'd be able to move on to different learning topics sooner ",If I was to give advice my advice would be to study one topic in your bay every night and then move to a different topic and study that even if you haven't learned it in class yet
To get a stable foundation where I could build my resume and become more successful ,I would like to learn a little bit more about my MOS in basic training,I'm not sure ,I don't have any thoughts
Will be a fourth gen military and also I join for my daughter,I would like more run with just my battle buddy when we are on personal time,I would like more run with just my battle buddy when we are on personal time,Nothing 
2003,"I wish we had more food, and good weather ",Learn more about BCT before joining,Not that I know of
To be put in a better situation ,I think they should bring back shark attacks ,Getting yelled at a lot,No
"For my six year plain, why ",The improvement thing ,I will find ways to make my dreams come true,Compete with the person I need to be 5 years from now 
,,,
I decided to join because I want be a better person and help my wife and family ,I didn't study for the asvab that well. But I still like my MOS ,Just be prepared and take notes of instructions ,Studying and sleep 
2003,I mean everything is what I expected to happen in basic training ,It's hard and challenging but it's all for the better to make yourself a better person and to serve you're country ,None whatsoever 
2003,Yeah,"I just miss family, that's its ","No, it's just a mindset thing"
Skill,The people that are in the platoon can't control the people that talk and move in formation therefore we get cracked down on for no reason on our side ,"In a formation you are to stand at attention, not talk and not move until you are released. Some people don't care about that and get us in trouble",Look out for the people that don't care and bring incentives on the table for people that do
Education and to get away from home,,,
I wanted to do it instead of college,,,
To better myself and help support my niece ,120th gave me to big of pants and said it was fine and they gave me to big of pt shoes. But other than that I think everything is going well. I wish we didn't have to purchase the items we are already brought with us. ,When we first got here in reception the people were rude when you told them that stuff was to big and at the store you are made to purchase items even if your recruiter told you to bring them with you. ,I'm not sure if the people there are just stressed or if there is air of us they are trying to get through but we need the proper stuff so it makes it go easier for us through BCT. ,Just listen to the trainee if they say something is to big because we know our bodies best and what feels to big or to small
To buy my home and to start my business ,I wish I waited to join and get a better job ,I miss home a lot I sometimes wish I didn't join,Not really
"For a better life , I was in a difficult situation ",I wish I was more mentally and physically ready. And used to a controlled environment ,To get emotionally strong and used to not having everything down their way. And to exercise more. And that bad and sad days are gonna happen a lot ,I don't really. 
For my father who had to leave the army to raise my sister and I ,"I wish we had been informed more of the things that were going to happen, I was told that training was 9 week and 4 days but in reality it's 11 weeks so I wish for more communication",That I know I need to be flexible but I want to be more informed about what's happening ,The drill Sargents don't want us to know everything that's happening during training but for some of us that's how we stay positive ,More communication 
I joined because I wanted a better life for myself and also to get away from home and see the world ,Well I wish I would have exercised before I came to basic training because now my body not use to the pt we are doing ,I would describe it as start doing your tasks before time so you wouldn't have to go threw the difference phases ,I have to work harder 
To use it as a stepping stone to build as a person and to help pay for college ,Instead of sitting in the classroom I wish we were able to start learning more of the cadences and March more ,Marching and singing different cadences more instead of sitting in the classroom ,Covid test when the platoons all arrive so the females can move into the platoons faster 
"To help people, for college, and to set a example for my younger brothers and sisters ",When we got off the plane we didn't get to sleep until the next night and it made it hard and confusing to get all the paper work done and listen to people without falling asleep and we all brought a lot of things that we didn't need and had to carry for no reason ,Don't bring a lot of stuff just one pair of clothes to change into a tooth brush personal care items and that's all ,No
"I joined because I believe you should serve of you able to. To be apart of a cause bigger then yourself. Plus I would get to travel, my school paid for. ",I wish the females and males were together from the start. Now that we are starting to merge I feel as if we are behind on some of the stuff the males are doing. The food could definitely be better. Besides that everything else is going smooth ,What do you mean ,"For our company the females are not allowed to learn cadences, and stuff like that. We just got the basic yellow phase information ",Just keeping everyone merged from the beginning instead of separating females from the males 
School ,Yes,Cool,No 
Make a better life for me,Twice as much food that we get per meal for everyone ,You have to eat all your food in less than 15 minutes ,Making everyone wake up earlier 
Family influence and paying for college,,,
For college education ,So I won't have to carry much stuff,Don't bring so much personal stuff because you will be given most of the items you need and more,Make a checking list of necessary stuff to bring
College and family,"We only do morning pt, chow, and classes","We exercise, eat and learn stuff about bct",No
Sure that's fine I join the army to work on myself ,"Sure I never really worked out before that includes running, push up etc",I would tell that person that they should work on their body strength and endurance before coming to boot camp,Not as yet
I've wanted to join since I was around 8 or 9 years old. I also wanted to better myself and become stronger.,No,...,No
Army has good opportunities ,Yellow phase is too boring and I expected more,Disappointing ,No 
Personal growth,There are a lot of people in my platoon who don't care and that makes my experience much worse,People don't care about anything but themselves ,Nope
"Student loan repayment, Grad school benefits.",There's nothing I could have done differently.,Just stay motivated ,No
"You're welcome , I joined to try to instill discipline and make my family proud ",I haven't had enough time to decide if i would do anything differently,"I would say wait until you get out of yellow phase to decide , because it is the same thing everyday ",Not at the moment i do not 
To buy a hellcat,It was a lot of waiting around ,That the first 2 weeks are slow and boring but it picks up after that ,Just no more yellow phase 
,,,
Yea sure,No,I don't know ,Drill seargents getting to know their trainees more 
For college benefits,We were left alone for various hours without anything to do,It's a lot of sitting and waiting,It's dependent on the people in charge 
for financial reasons & a backup plan. & to be more disciplined & apart of something bigger.,as far as us getting our periods every month & us needing products. they don't provide for us enough. ,"""my drill sergeants didn't seem to care about the females' feminine hygiene"" ","not on my own , no."
it was just always a goal once i started high school and i didn't know exactly what i wanted to do after  ,like some girls came in knowing most things already ,like knowing the orders and stuff,reading my skills level 1 book 
I wanted to be part of something bigger than myself. Wanted to succeed & have a better lifestyle ,I think everything was fine ,I'm having a good time ,Nope 
the benefits buts mostly financial support to have a good foundation and try for custody of my niece ,"i know we're learning to be disciplined but some events seemed too much, but other than that i think it's a good training environment ",to be ready for anything because you don't know when something or someone isn't going to go how to thought or believed it to go,just increase of communication and a little more understanding. perception and how the leadership perceives something is important with their respect but trainees can also perceive the situation and something wholly different
I decided to join to get the benefits the army provides for schooling ,We ran out of personal hygiene products fast and we need more ,It's hard to get your essentials here not like in the civilian world were if you run out you get to go to the store whenever you want ,Just to have time to go to the store 
I wanted to challenge myself and be part of a large scale group. Also the benefits ,Lots of drill sergeants weren't  aware of some trainees issues that were elaborated with other drill Sargents  causing issues that would've been prevented through better communication. Issues being medical or along those lines where trainees are different from the rest ,Communication within drill sergeants and trainees is bad ,Be more organized or have noticeable things on trainees so drill Sargents can know 
,,,
because i didn't wanna go to collage and my dad always said growing up it was his biggest regret not joining so it made me want to even more ,there hasn't been anything i wish was different ,i would say that basic training has been hard and you have to keep pushing ,no i don't because it's already been good
To prove to my little brother that you can do anything that you set you're mind to,Everything had gone fine,If you put the work in you will get better results out of everything you are doing,No
Needed a job ,It's not as bad as I thought it would be but it's a little of what I expected ,I thought I would get yelled at a lot more but I havent ,No 
I joined because I wanted to change my life and I may have a kid on the way not sure till this Sunday or next Sunday when we get phones again ,Like I study like I'm supposed to but I usually forget what I just learned ,I would try to tell them to use some note cards or something ,I could ask my battle buddies to help me study 
It's a long story. ,"Food services. When we eat, what we eat, and how much we eat. Throughout the day I feel light-headed because I feel I'm eating meals with two far gaps. If they provide energy bars throughout the day that'll help a ton. ","In BCT they feed us well, but not enough. ",Give out 3 or 4 bars throughout meals. 
Education,Eating on the floor was messy and seemed inefficient ,"We ate on the floor for 15 minutes right after rolling around in dirt. the servers couldn't wash their hands with soap and water, we instead used hand sanitizer but that turned the dirt into mud. It was more unsanitary than MRES and lead to a lot of food waste. ",Provide access to hand soap or disinfecting wipes. Have access to running water. Have people other than the trainees serving food. 
I wanted to experience the military life style. I'm hoping to join West Point this year so before I go I want to be able to adapt quicker and better.,I think it would have gone a lot better if it weren't for COVID. I can't blame the army for not letting us get up to task because their following orders to prevent us from getting COVID.,"COVID really delayed our tasks and activities such as doing the obstacle courses and more. Because we were unable to do these things on the normal set date, we had slot of gray empty space in between schedules. We usually would clean up our bay but it got to the point where things got boring. ",Hard to think of. But definitely having everyone vaccinated would ease the pressure. People who refuse the vaccine should be recycled. In my opinion
I needed to be able to provide for my wife and two kids.also I wanted to get stronger ,I'm 6'7 and the two blankets I got issued are a little short for me,The blankets are for short people,Next time go by the trainees height and give them a blanket that's at least a foot longer than them
Follow in the foot steps of my grandfathers ,We sit on a concrete slab outside like we are animals in a way and eat our food ,"I would tell them ""Hey they make you sit on the ground like animals and eat your food""",No
To better myself and make a difference ,"Yellow phase felt as if i was wasting
My time because I am vaccinated but still had to quarantine and slow my progression through bct ",Yellow phase wasted my time ,More organization and different places for vaccinated people 
I joined the army for the financial and secondary education opportunities. I have a brother with autism I need to help financially support as he grows up and I'd also like to have the funding and backing up he able to finish my Bachelors Degree in Nutrition Sciences ,"There's too much downtime. I've been incredibly bored over the last three weeks which has effected my moral and my motivation. I'm a highly motivated person who entered excited to go through the process, but the first two weeks of doing not much but PT--which I enjoy as a physically fit person--cleaning the bay over and over and over again, and then either get smoked or sitting in 10 minute classes learning not much has really left me entering red phase with a low morale and low motivation ","You will entered BCT expecting to jump right into Red Phase and warrior tasks and Drill, however, before red phase, there's a 1-2 week yellow phase which is COVID related, and during that phase you will be performing a lot of PT, personal hygiene, and learning some of the basics such as marching",Just understanding time management better. Making our yime here worthwhile
I've always wanted to serve my country.,Nothing should be done differently,Bct is not that bad but does take some getting used to.,No
To get financial stability for my family ,Recruiters should inform the people they recruit better about how it's going to be in basic,So that the people going into basic can be prepared and less people get injured during physical training ,Making sure that recruiters inform people better 
"I decided to join because I come from a military family so I felt like it was my turn to ""pick up the torch"". Also my dream is to be a Chinook pilot for the US Army ",More food. Maybe as a reward for cleanliness in the bay allow recruits to have 1-2 extra MRE's on top of their locker just for extra calories and nutrition. Besides that really nothing.,We get 3 meals a day with 4 hours between each except at night here it's a 14 hour fast... so you are always stay in a state of calorie deficit. And it makes it hard to gain muscle mass and weight for us skinnier people. ,"The small meals, mainly the ""Hot A's"" food from the defac as it's isn't always the best and you have set portions while the MRE's have enough to fill you up. But really just the portions are small",Bigger portions or one more MRE at night 
Steady pay,It just seems like they don't know what to do with me at my current status. ,The same way,Finishing survey quicker
I joined the army to start a future career and to push myself even further than before,I wish I could've seen what college was like before joining the military ,Try going to college before you join the military. You could get way more benefits than just joining the military ,Better life decisions 
I decided to join the Army because I have always wanted to and I wanted a profession where I serve people rather than serve a business ,"I would say not having to wear a mask everywhere, it's really hot here at Ft. Jackson and I found it hard to breathe during PT. As far as the training itself I thought that it was great preparation for red phase ","During physical training you will have to wear a mask and it is very uncomfortable, the drill Sargents are tough but conduct good training ",Im not sure I never studied virology but I would say look at every option besides just masks and vaccines 
"Becouse i want be a best person, i like the military life and its a good oportunity for me and my familia ",I like the training i donde want change,I describe like great,Just traing more stronge
1990,Yeah ,I can't think of anything ,For financial security and to be part of something bigger than myself.
I joined to better myself as a person,,,
College and to keep the family name in the military ,I feel like the MRE meals are better than the chow food,The mre meals have more variety ,No
Education ,There is nothing I wish that was done differently everything is fine for me,I would come with the right mindset when entering the army expect the worse,Nothing to fix
Because I wanted to ,No,It will be hard,No
I join to keep myself out of trouble and to better myself and set myself up for the future,So if I could change something I would just try to make the weather less hot because it's very hot outchea,In fort Jackson it's hot so I would try to make it somehow cooler ,Just keep swimming
l like uniform and it's honor for me to serve America ????,"like organizing myself ,work in team ,training to be strong physically and mentally ",l can tell them that veritable live is military live because it make live simply and powerful ,
To find something to do with my life,I'm not sure what I feel like could have been done different.,BCT is not easy but not impossible ,Not sure. It's my second week of BCT what do you expect of me
Benefits and to improve my skills,I don't see anything that needs to be changed,Basic Training wasn't as complex or difficult as I thought so far,Not really
Family influence ,There is nothing that comes to mind ,It is a starting phase that introduces you to what you will be going through ,Not sure 
To learn new skills,It's a new experience to me and  I'm not sure what could be improved,It's alot of discipline and following introductions ,Being more communicational
To blow stuff up ,Phone time during Sunday would be nice if it were longer ,In BCT we only get our phones on Sunday for 30 minutes ,No clue I just got here 
To better myself and get away from my home town,Like comfortability,Break in boots as soon as possible and access to things for injury's quicker ,Take reception more seriously because that was the easiest part so far 
i want to be a police officer after the service and i feel like this is good a good thing to do plus you have to be 21 when you get to be a police officer and ill be that age when i get out ,"when the captain first spoke to us, it was out it the heat cat 5 ",same way i told you ,
I dont know,We been doin hella shit i think we should be able to rest our muscles more,We are overworking our muscles sometimes in intense heat and i think we should get more rest time,Change up the standards
I have a friend in the army as a infantryman,I felt the 2 weeks went normal as basic training should be ,Challenging ,Having specific people organize the mail 
Money... but I was lied too ,It's really hot here,Yeah right,Fix global warning 
Money,More per portions ,The food was decent but I wasn't full after every meal,
To make my parents proud and help them financially ,The drill sergeants were tuff and didn't explain things properly they just got mad and didn't end up helping ,The teachers are mean,
It's just been something I've wanted to do for a long time now,No,It sucks if you get covid and they wont care,More covid tests
Board ,I did everything in my power to listen to the drill sergeants ,I listened to the authority to the best of my ability ,
I decided to join for educational and disciplinary reasons,Everything was great,I think that the training was good and nothing was very out of the ordinary from what I expected ,No issue
I always wanted to serve in uniform and the Army aligned with my values,Fix the bed better,Make the bed to a ridiculously high standard,
"I joined to make a life for myself, to become a man, to get an education, and to find myself.",Trainees never know what's going on when we have to do something,"If we communicate better, less people will have miscommunications ",Teach drill sergeants how to communicate
I wanted to do something else then what my parents wanted me to do,I wish we would've took the time we used standing around to train for other events besides just the push ups and the 2 mile run,We wasted a lot of time practicing push-ups and the 2 mile run when the weaker events such as the deadlift and sprint drag carry could have been practiced during the times we were standing around waiting for instruction,The drill Sargents take a lot of time chatting and socializing amongst each-other while we sit and wait for further instructions and it waste a significant amount of time,I think the schedule for a day of basic training could be improved drastically to stop wasting time
No,No,"Umm, I don't know",BRUHHHHH
Education benefits,Could be ran more smoothly,It's ran very slowly and could be expedited,None
Hi this is Lee,I think can change the temparature of water at shower rooom will be coool it is just only hot,Hard ,Call more

I wanted to become a pilot,The food wasn't the best and the MRE is the best,BCT is physically and mentally tough but trains you to become a soldier,Nope
I decided to join because I wanted help paying for my education and I wanted to provide for my family,Well I kinda felt lost. I never knew what I was gonna go for the day and I had no one I could personally speak to about my anxiety,You'll never know what your going to do next,No
Cause I got a wife and a 2 month old baby at home ,I wouldn't have done nothing differently ,You getting paid to work out and get yelled at ,No
My brother who is currently serving,I thought covid was the only problem but cant think of anything that can really stop it from spreading so i have no feedback,Try to prevent covid spread before bct,No clue
Secure future financially,I wish I had better contact with family,Almost constantly being away from family is harder then people think,Give trainees their phones more often
2003,The way how each drill sergeants do things differently and recruits get yelled at ,Make sure to do what the drill sergeant tell you to do but it might effect you different when other drill sergeants get mad at you if you do something different then what you were told by your actually drill sergeant ,No

Because I wanted to make a good living and make a family ,The lockers we got were really busted up and old,We had old lockers to hold our stuff in and the latches are broken and old ,
i joined the army for multiple reasons but the main reason lies on my parents's being undocumented and I would like to change that ,no ,it's a lot of sacrifice but will be rewarding in the long run,
The benefits ,Like I hate being away from my family ,The mental part of BCT is hard ,

Educational benefits ,A lot of errors and discrepancies ,Uncertainty ,Better communications 
So I can support a future family with the Va loan and the post 9/11 gi bill,Cuz it's hot,It's a bin of ice water and u dip ur arms in it for about 20 seconds ,Just have it schedule in the plan of the day
I want an education and a great experience in the military lifestyle.,"I feel like if we get to keep our weapons on our arms, we would learn to never leave our equipment out of arms reach in a real combat situation.",Always keep your belongings around you so nobody can steal it from you.,Sorry no
For my family,No,I probably couldnt,No i dont
Pay for tuition ,"We don't have enough time for personal hygiene, especially in the morning ",We didn't have enough time to conduct personal hygiene ,Just cut down on all the wait time 
So I can go to the film college of my choice,Not shouting as many expletives,"The drill sergeants at BCT swear a lot when they're trying to intimidate people; it doesn't really work for people who already swear, and it doesn't really make me comfortable when I get sweared at ",It isn't hard; just let the drill sergeants be human to their platoons
i needed money and i wanted to be a better person,better food,i want my food seasoned ,season tha food
"Many members of my family have been in the military, theres many benefits, I loved the idea of wearing the uniform and preforming the duties. Also need some financial help for education ","And actually I'm from Pennsylvania, I'm sorry I thought you meant which base I'm at rn. And I wish I would have studied more for the yellow phase test",That there are different ranks and different people in those ranks who are higher than me. As well as the army motto,Taking more from my free time to study and prepare
I enjoy serving. I'm a cop back at my home town,Depending on your position that you eat in it sometimes runs out. Like today we ran out of rice so half of my platoon didn't get rice,Get in the front of the line,Love you talk to you later
Alabama,No,Wating for red phase and being irritated that you have to eat on the floor.,"I just said them. This is useless. If your going to make us do this, at least give us better questions and have it be optional, or more statistics than just answering questions."
i just graduated and didn't know what to do with my life ,"before i got here i didn't doo anything soo when i got here it sucked cause i wasn't in shape or anything, i felt like shit but it's slowly getting better and it not sucking as much ","you run a lot, you work out a lot, and you get yelled at for fucking up over little shit, but you get paid for it  ",
"I decided to join because I wanted to experience something different and better myself originally, once I realized I also am here to secure a better future for myself and my family.",I think the training was good however for the people that aren't as physically fit I think that we shouldn't go so hard on running ,Larger people don't run as much,Well drill sergeants are too hard on larger people for obvious reasons however they just can't go as far as a more physically fit person,Honestly I got no clue
To make my self better,Fighting training,HAND ON HAND COMBAT TRAINING!,No
My children,"Not much to say. Hard times with covid, I think it was best with what is given.  Can not ask for anything elze","Training for the military but with an global epidemic, done right",No

I wanted to be more adventurous and get some experience in other things besides the basics of life. ,Ummm.... I just think that the chefs should pay attention when they serve out the food for us and give us the right amount. ,Give us the right amount of food. ,I just want to make sure that every one gets the right amount of food and also if you need more food I think that u should be able to get more and not have to worry about running out. 
Educational purpose ,Maybe salt and pepper packets with the hot A’s and a calendar for trainees,Better food and a calendar ,Get seasoning and calendar 
I question that all the time,Not enough food I'm usually hungry but I'm a 6ft teenager with the appetite of a whale,The food is bland and comes in meager amounts ,No I'd probably get smoked if j said something 
to better my future,we always run out of food ,we want more meat or protein ,get more food for the trainees because we need to eat to put on muscle 
For college benefits,Just so I wouldn't be as confused and didn't have to ask my battle buddies to many question and could rely on myself a majority of the time.,It'd save you a lot a of stress and you wouldn't get smoked all the time. You and your drill sergeants would be happier.,just to pay more attention to detail
I wanted more Discipline and to be able to provide for my family better ,Less standing around and more training we are already living together as a bay I don't understand why we have to wait so long to get more training in ,We had to Quarantine for 2 weeks and we basically didn't do anything ,Test for COVID more frequently

Plenty of reasons. Mostly for my own growth as a person in general.,I just want to be able to stay connected directly with my loved ones.,I'm sure they know how it feels to be disconnected to someone at one point or another.,Asking the higher-ups in the chain if command for more time with out phones.
I decided to join because ever since i was young I've looked up to people who were in the military and I would like to have free schooling ,I enjoyed it because we were able to learn about weapons and physical stuff before the stress of red phase ,We learned different exercises and weapon maintenance before we started doing obstacle courses and similar things to that ,No everything's fine 
I wanted a challenge and something to make me feel whole ,I wish we had our phones during personal time or a limited time everyday so that we can call or text family instead of using letters ,"I can't because I only have my phone once a week, I would tell them that it sucks here ",Give us our phones more often 
to set up my future for me and my girl. i also did not want to pay for college. ,i often find myself hungry. i am hungry right now,i often find myself hungry. i am hungry right now,not my pay grade

There's no reason we should be eating that much sugar"
So it can look good on my resume to be a police officer,When given instructions i should do them to my max,Always give your maximum effort ,Getting more rest
Because I need to prove it to myself,Everything was fine in my eyes,Everything is what you expect and more,"Nope, don't wanna fix it"
So i wont be a disappoint to my family anymore,covid-19 hit when i was in basic last year and i got sent home,covid-19 hit when i was in basic last year and i got sent home,get rid of covid-19 regulations
Mom had cancer so I wanted to prove to myself that I can make it through basic training ,"I've done it before and it's awesome, but because of COVID the army put in an extra phase in training and took out certain events in the training ",You have a basic helmet and you hit people with bus sticks,
the benefits and bc my grandpa was in the Vietnam war,the masks suck ass I wish I didn't have to wear it,working out with a mask is hard,burn the masks
There's many reasons ,,,
I wanted to set up my life to be stable and get a career ,I really miss my family like a lot and I'm feeling very disconnected with them. I'm also from California so my letters take a long time to get here. ,I would tell them that it sucks not being able to talk to my family,I think that me not being able to talk to them on the regular or like have my phone for sure every Sunday for more then 10 minutes is really hard on me mentally ,"I think that you can give us our phones for longer, we try our hardest all week to only be rewarded for 10 minutes "

Education benefits,We were rushed through and I wasn't able to get some items I needed. I had to borrow some items until we could go to the px again after 2 weeks,More time to shop,No
I heard the army was a great place to make friends,Because the female were in a made up platoon we had different drill sergeants telling us what to do without ,Bye,Bye bye
Educational benefits ,,,
I was born,I wished there were different ways to different things,People learn different in ways,Not really
Family ,Multiple trainees fail to keep track of their gear because everyone else's gear is thrown about the room ,Keep spaces between each other and having a hand full of people issuing items rather than grabbing ourselves ,Having one simple method of issuing 
"Wanted to get something for myself, earn it ",Instead of being standing for a while maybe get weapons quicker etc?,But it's a process so it's understandable,"Not really, just trainees such as myself have to pick up slack"
2003,I could have done more working out on a daily basis ,Treat your body right no matter the circumstances ,Continue to push your self past the limit to extend your body function
For my family ,Maybe pass more time with my family ,,
I'm from florida,,,
I whant to help my comunity and put out fires and stop riots ,If you need somthing  2 tolets dont work and a dryer is also not working wich sucked because we need those ,The toilets dont work and a dryer dosnot work causing a line to build up to use the ones still working ,The bays can be inspeted between cycles 
To succeed in doing something difficult. I was bored with my old life.,"I wish things were better organized and scheduled. Also, people lie to you about things all the time about basically everything, and it's hard to know what's true.",No one knows anything and everything is confusing.,"Lack of organization. Also people in authority feeding those below them information that they don't really have or isn't confirmed, or that changes a week after and is useless.","Get better accountability on how information is disseminated. In general, better organization. Don't tell people things that turn out to be untrue later."
,,,
Poor life choice ,It slows down the intensity of training ,Covid precautions kills training ,Get vaccinated 
For myself and too better my work ethic as well as make a good starter in my career,I don't have any regrets,I like what I comited to and I'm happy with my choice,No

My dad and my uncle ,Pull ups and chin ups,Do more pull ups to improve strength ,No
"I decided to join for the experience, since joining rotc in High School I thought it would be interesting. I also joined for college benefits.

for the flight experience ,everything was fine just training ,The training was extremely hard but it'll mold you into a solider ,no
I don't know. ,I cannot think of anything I would like to have been done differently.,"There's no need for improvement, in my opinion.",I do not have any such thoughts.
For the benefits and college ,Everyone could have been taught almost the same because most of us were taught how to do this differently and now we are all together and we have to start over as a platoon,,
To make my parents and family proud and to start my life,,,
To carry on my family legacy and to feel a sense of purpose ,I worked out some. But not enough. I've got lots of work to do,Done more exercising,Giving This my 100% all

Benefits ,Everything seemed fine ,You get used to it,No need to fix anything 
I joined to get a Scatpack Charger ,They call all of us trainees instead of by our names but if they called us by our names  I think that would be more respectful ,It's respect ,Have the drill Sargents call us by our real names or even last names
I wanted to serve my country and get my college paid for as well,"Reception just felt like it had dragged on forever and lasted longer than it needed to, I understand it was all necessary but the fact that it didn't even count towards our 10 weeks for basic was a little discouraging ",Reception should count towards your 10 weeks of basic because otherwise it feels like basic lasts way longer than it should ,No thoughts 
To serve the nation and better myself,Everything was good,My time here has been great,"More running, more physical training, more hands on learning activity "
to get out of a home situation ,sometimes people weren't in the same page or a lot of things we were told got switched around ,the was a mix up in what trainees where told at times ,
"To serve, and see the world ",I feel like I'm not getting enough to eat. ,I still feel like I'm hungry after I eat. ,
To better myself and my family ,That whole sequence was just full of rude manered people not talking about the drill sargents but the other workers ,Reception is the worst part it'll make you think twice about joining the military there alone it's the begging of breaking you,No
I joined because I didn't have a good path set out ahead of me. I needed a job and I wanted to serve my country ,Several washers and dryers didn't work and the floors were often wet. Also the AC was not working at in processing.,Floors were often wet in the laundry room and the AC didn't work at the place where I was being processed,The AC wasn't working just because the unit wasn't working I assume and the laundry room floors were always wet because they weren't grated properly to drain and one of the washers was leaking,Fix the washing machine leaking and properly grate the floors and maintain AC units properly
So that I can be able to support my mother who was in the military ,Nothing that I can think of that I would want to change differently about the last two week of training I've went though ,BCT so far from my experience has been going well and can already feel my self becoming more discipline from just two weeks of being here in Fort Jackson South Carolina. ,None 
I choose to army so i can make a change and make a better name for myself and to serve ,I've had a headache ever since I got here and the nothing they can do except sick call and me made missing some days,That there where no over the the counter pills for headaches ,Just have something for the pain
To get a head start in life and to get established early,"I felt that everything was what I expected. Nothing more, nothing less",BCT is exactly what everyone has heard,
To help with college ,Nothing that comes to mind when you ask me,I don't know,No
I join because I need to start a better life for my self,Like we got here and the drill sergeant tell us we in red phase and before they told us it's starts Monday,So basic is split up in phases and we was in yellow the next phase is red and we was told we don't change phases yet but my drill sergeant told us we was,
"I joined to better myself, travel the world, and for new experiences","I think everything was done well, and with good purpose",Everything that we do in basic training goes along with things that we would have to do in real time on the battle field,No
I wanted to make something of myself ,I can't think of anything I would change ,Everything is done for a reason ,
"I joined the Army Reserve to make a living for myself, and to honor the family members who came before me.","When I first arrived I was giving 5 minutes to take a shower, at least 10 minutes would be better.","When arriving to BCT you are given a short amount of time to shower before bed, and being rushed while doing it.",Focus on some Drill Sergeants on how they treat their Platoons.
Because I love my country ,The drill sergeants we good,As long as you listen and try your best you will be fine. They give simple directions and you follow them,Nope

To provide for my daughter better,Switch to personal shoes quicker,Sometime the running shoes issue hurt your feet ,Not sure 
Benifits and for an extra push,Not really ,I couldn't ,Nope
I joined to better myself. I didn't like the thought of college or just going straight into the work force,"It was quite a hassle to switch bays, and although I understand it's part of the process of being a solider. I wish we had a singular hub we knew we were gonna be during the entirety of BCT",Switching bays in the middle of BCT is not fun,Not really
Help my pay for college,"Because of how many people there was in reception, when my platoon had something to do, we had to wait for hours before the platoon infront of us was finished. ",It's extremely boring and mentally draining. You can't talk or do anything except for reading your smart book ,Have people be nicer to us. I didn't feel very welcome when I arrived
"I didn't want to be the typical teenager to go to collage and be stuck with student loans, and I wanted to get out of my home quick without relying on anyone.",I ended up trying to enjoy my last few weeks at home. And ate lots of junk food and relaxed rather than getting ready for BCT.,You need to be fit atleast a bit the moment you ship,
2002,Just more food,"Out of the 3 meals a day, more food","Just see people weight, keep track, and give more portions accordingly"
I joined to try something new in my life,They turn you away to fast thinking your faking your injury's. And making you go back to training ,Can't find the words right now,No
I had a son about 10 months ago wanted to create a better living for him. ,Prepared properly just mental wise it kinda hit you pretty hard if you have already been under tension in life. I work out m-f in my personally life but more weights & less cardio so the working out is kicking my butt ,It's all a learning process it's like really you don't even know who you are until you get put in a situation like this to where you lose everything you thought you knew about yourself & have to find a deeper purpose. ,The  heat !!! It's hot in SC fort Jackson is boiling I can't lie and on top of people screaming at you it cause for an crazy combo ,"I think the bathrooms can be more clean honestly , I feel the drill SGT's are good with discipline but marching in the heat is dangerous to me cuz I feel woozy sometimes. "
"God, country, family. Make family proud","There was broken washing machines and a lot of yhe lockers had lots of rust, and some were broken",There was rust and broken machines,New machines
For a better future for me and my future family ,There's not much really. One thing is I don't like the fact that we have to share a bay with a platoon that we are not in. Like there whole platoon is together but the males of 1st got split up ,I would want to be in the same sleeping quarters wit my platoon other then being split up ,Maybe do better in keeping the platoons together 
"I joined to try to gain the benefits of the Army, and prepare for an upcoming crisis.",The order in which PT Training is conducted.,"Which exercise to begin with, and which exercise to end with.",No.
I joined for the benefits and to go to college,We waited a little longer than expected for the busses to come retrieve us,I don't know,I have no thoughts about improving this
To get out of a toxic home environment. ,"How quickly we were given information to retain and how quickly we had to memorize it, I feel should have been a bit slower in my opinion ",We had only a few hours at times to know information we were given. ,
To be apart of something that is bigger then myself,Everything went well,"It's not bad, I would recommend ",No
College funds and a break from household issues,As in we were placed by our last names and not random choosing like they told us,We were split up into groups by last name alphabetically and not by random choosing,They need to communicate with each other more often to not confuse the trainees that's all
To better myself and make my family proud ,I wish we did a little bit more running ,Run more than you think you'll need to,Nope 
I wanted to serve and explore the world,Just more encouragement from my peers and drill Sargent's ,Give some motivation like telling someone they did good,
To better myself and it has been something I always wanted to do since middle school ,Nevermind,I have no idea ,No 
To better myself as a person and have college benefits ,"There is not anything that has to be changed maybe Some of the Chow options, but that cant really be determined because we are in early stages of training. ",The lunch is okay and we workout all day,No
to travel to japan,phones everyday ,have phones everyday during personal time,
Family tradition and travel,Well they want us to go into basic having established teamwork but put us in yellow phase where we establish a connection and then 2 weeks later we are broken apart and integrated with the male platoons and have to restart with establishing teamwork,You make friends but then after a couple of weeks are broken up and have to go to other people,Get rid of yellow phase and make reception a week longer for quarantine
College,No,"One drill sergeant would say one thing, the other would say something different ",I have no clue how it would improve tbh 
Family tradition,"The MRE fill your stomach comfortably every time, but when you eat defac food the portions can be low","So trainees give you 1 scoop of a certain food item in the lunch line, but some trainees don't care if thr scoop isn't filled/half full... meaning someone like me can't get the healthy amount of portions to maintain my calories ",Have plates pre-made or have trainees better understand the portioning amounts
I wanted to serve my country like my cousin and like my father did for korea. I also wanted to pay for my own college fees to help my family not spend money on me,"If there is a px or troop store close by and it is personal time, if we ask a drill sergeant and they say yes, 2+ trainees and the drill sergeant goes to the store",2 or more people will ask a leader in the area if they can go to the store to get supplies,Think one of the easiest solutions is to make the regulations for the px store in reception a lot more loose so people can buy more to prep for bct
To travel and start a career ,Having to wait long period of times in between different things we do ,Sitting a lot and waiting ,No
Personal challenge as well as supporting my family. I also want to set my self up for success while in the army. I did it for the greater good of my country realizing that I can make a difference ,No ,Everything prepares you for the next step it will all make sense later ,No 
To have a different life and for the benefits,Delta,There is not ,I do not 
I want to become an adult by the time I'm 20 ,It was really boring ,You sit and stand all day while they try to get you all the shit u need for basic ,No
"To travel, get away from home, meet new people, and to have the experience.","Training itself has been good. I want more time in the classroom to go over stuff we absolutely need to know. The food is okay just wish there was more choices beside chicken, rice.","We have a book that has red stars next to things we need to know, I want to be able to go and study in a classroom with everyone so I can ask questions. ",Being able to talk to them and having more time
Dream job ,Nothing I would change,I like the experience of BCT so far and would not change anything ,Provide better toiletries 
Family ,No comment ,No comment,No comment 
I thought it would make me a better person. ,"The sand we did PRT in hurt my elbows. Other than that, my first two weeks was alright. Can't complain about the food or anything else. ","The Drill SGTs make you go out at 5:00 in the morning and do exercises in a sandy area. Hurts your elbows. The exercise itself isn't bad, but that sand is a pain.","Actually, yeah, put Anakin Skywalker in charge of landscaping. He really doesn't like sand, either, so it would work."
2002,I wish we had gotten more hands on with our weapons to understand how to handle them better ,I would describe it the same way,More one on one time with the trainees in their platoons 
To become a better person ,like better food for the trainees ,better food service for people in training ,"no, I think it's something the staff  has to deal with "
To use the college benefits and better my life,I wish that I would've started basic training right after high school graduation so I could've gone through this already,"Basic training is better to do when u have the most length of free time on your hands, so if you can get an early ship date, close to the start of the summer, then they should do it",I explained it to you up there
I decided to joint the army because I wanted my family to be proud of me and I want to help them out with what I can. I will be the first one in my whole family to join the Army and any Branch of the military,For us to be able to have snacks but like limited snacks. ,Nice talking to you see you later. ,
I wanted to serve for my country ,There's nothing that should be changed,I would tell them that's it's not as bad as it seems,No
For the job and work experience ,I can't think of anything I wish to be different ,,
I joined to better myself and help out my family ,It gets hard to breathe in the heat and all,Like we have to wear masks durning bct but some of us are vaccinated and shouldn't have to ,Not sure 
A mixture of being used to a similar environment and wanting to set my life up for success ,Just getting more sleep would be helpful ,Just needing more sleep because we do a lot of physical activity ,Just allowing break times throughout the day for optional sleeping
"I wanted to start my life, this was a family tradition, and i also plan on getting my girlfriend out of the situation shes in ",I feel that some platoons had it harder because some Drill Sergeants teamed up on different platoons for a simple mistake others made that didnt get corrected ,Lets say a teacher that isnt your teacher walks into your classroom and tells you to stop fuckin looking around and controls everything you do and your teacher is okay with it,
To make a better living for myself,"Yellow phase is 2 weeks of basically nothing besides PT and taking notes on carbines and shooting. Having rifles in hand is a much better process to have when learning to shoot, therefor put yellow and red phase back together.",Yellow phase is basically just a quarantine from the main training area. Basically yellow phase should be combined with red phase as before as it would be obstacles and a little rest after obstacles ,No
I joined to get out of affiliations ,Not really I mean more competitions,I wish the 2 weeks of yellow phase were more competitive ,Nope
Job opportunities ,Training has been fine ,Training is just how you'd expect,Nope
i decided to join because i want the benefits,"everything is fine here, i've just been battling with my myself mentally and physically, and btc helps with that ",i just miss my family,"no, there's nothing i can really do"
To make my mom proud,I wished I worked out more,Do more push ups,Easier drill srgts
Oh sorry ,And my MOS is 25U,Delta company ,When transitioning with the males their drill Sargent did things a bit different than the previous drill sergeant that the females had so most of us were a bit confused in formation. I just wish they would of clarified things a bit more. ,I think we just have to adapt to the new changes 
"I love to travel, and I wanted to start/ have a career.","I fell, I had to get Ct scans to rule out bleeding. But I had a mild concussion from the fall.",Be careful of your surroundings ,Be careful 
Fayetteville North Carolina ,84th company,The food coulda have been better,Nothing it's not to bad
College,"Nothing needs improving, everything is fine",BCT is easy as long as you keep a steady head ,No
I decided to join because the military is very diverse and the army had the best choices to offer in terms of benefits and education.,I wish that we went on more runs and did more pushups ,I would like to do more exercise daily ,Get up earlier and get a good workout in with the platoon 
The Marine Corps wouldn't take me,The girls had to move into the guy bays so bay 4 had to split up because they couldn't facilitate all the males and females without separating a platoon from eachother,Each platoon has a SquadBay and when the females integrated with the males the company didn't have enough bays so they had to break apart a whole platoon just so the girls could have their own bay so now the male platoon that got split up can't work with each other and practice drill in our free time.,Making sure there is enough space to facilitate maximum personnel without causing separation between platoons. Like lowering the maximum persons per cycle or upgrading the facility to facilitate more people
I was tired of being regular! Wanted to improve my discipline and my way of life.,The one week of reception felt like the first two weeks of yellow phase. Which is insane cause in reception we didn't even do pt. ,Its way too long and unnecessary ,No im not sure. Maybe hold tighter schedules. Maybe more workers to help move things along.
I decided to join for the opportunities and the benefits ,Well everything so far has gone real good ,"So it's easy to tell, in basic training you experiment from the beginning on how it feels to be a soldier, you see big names and honorable soldiers, it's a good experience only to some ",No 
Mustang ,Yeah,Nun,No
it was the next step i chose in life (its beneficial),like if you get a profile you cant graduate and if they want to destroy ur body because they dont use anisthetics they might just hurt u bad enough for u to get recycled ,medical is rough and worst than basic itself ,get real doctors or take kids to a real hospital that uses anesthetics to pull teeth stuff like that 
My dad,Worked on cardio ran more,Unbelievable amount of prt,No 
To become more financially stable and to get away from home ,No ,I wish I took extra classes in school to make more money in the army ,Yes 
To serve my country and to start a good career active duty in the National Guards ,More time to ourselves at night ,"Being able to have time at night to ourselves to do laundry, write letters, chat with the battle buddy's, or anything else personal ",Later lights out time 
I joined because I didn't want to go to college ,We have been doing a little bit of everything but we don't really understand how things work,Is like learning only the surface ,Have a study group
2002,"W
",T,7t
Kind of a family thing. It's something I've wanted to do since I was like 10. I'm planning on doing 20 years if I like it and making a career of it.,Like in the US ARMY they are going to do things the way they are supposed to do them. As a trainee my job is to just say ok and do what I'm told.,Exactly how I just explained it above,No
College tuition,Everything was fine,It went good,I said nothing how do I elaborate on that
2001,4th platoon,Delta company ,What's causing its the lack of time
For a good career future and my country ,I need more food to keep from losing weight and for my body to heal and have energy,I'm hungry ,Give more food in line
Better myself ,There are people on the spectrum in the same platoon as me ,I guess they let anyone try out for the army,Mental checks
I decided to join so I can have a better life and for my family and for my future many reasons but mostly to support my family ,I think one thing that could of been done differently is just like the food maybe better or more food ,I would say that the food from BCT is not as good ,Probably just by making the food infront of us 
College ,It was about what I expect,Basic about what you expect ,Not sure 
I don't know ,Nothing ,Yes ,
Dont want to end up a loser,Couldnt follow the first couple days and had some mental issues with not being suited for the army and regretting my choice,Didnt believe I could do it due to a change in enviroment and I wanted out,Drill Sargents should care more 
Becuase my father and step dad both wanted to but were not able to ,When the drill Seargant's ask questions I want to be able to answer ,I would say that we are assigned a bunch of knowledge and we have to learn it ,That's about it 
Do you want specifics? ,,,
Taking care of my family for the future,Young people getting in trouble and have maturing to do and the rest of the platoon paying the price,Some of the recruits are very immature ,Maybe better information before they enlist
For the benifts and money ,Yes study more ,Study hard and Focus hard in class ,
"Free college, and a shorter bootcamp","Lots of drill sergeants are very aggressive and don't necessarily want to approach you as a human. But, a a great number of others are great at it.",You'll love some drill sergeants and very strongly dislike others.,
"I joined to afford college and have the money to set up my life, and to serve my country",Delta company,"I would make the covid restrictions more standard because it's fairly unorganized and completely ineffective in the grand scheme of things. Masks have to be off sometimes and not others, it won't stop the spread of anything if we do it like that, either do it the covid way or not at all, no in between",
My town is a really small town and there's nothing much to do and I want to do something bigger than myself ,Well do classes just like school. Talk about the topic more and go more in depth into it so we could have it in our heads instead of taking notes for 5 seconds a slide,Treat yellow phase like school class,No
"For the educational benefits, to improve myself as a person, and to make my parents proud","On my personal time, I would have liked to have done more excercises to get in better shape",I want to work out more,I should push myself more into working out
I felt lost in the world,"It sucks but I can handle, I'm not a pussy",It can get tough sometimes but keep your eyes on the goal,Never talk to the drill sergeant. I fuck it up every time
For the benefits and to secure a great career in the civilian world with what the army well teach me ,No clue at all ,,
"There's many reasons. To keep family tradition, to serve my country, the amazing benefits, the better myself as a human being, to learn independent skills and I was a very sheltered person so I needed this to make me a better and stronger person.",I wish that we could get a little more phone time on Sunday than just 15 minutes. Being away from family for the first time in my life was very hard for me and I just felt rushed in those short 15 minutes I had many people to call.,I would describe it by saying just to have more opportunities to speak with loved ones and family,Being away from family for the first time in my life has made me a little sad but it's normal. I know I'm gonna see them again when I graduate. ,Nope
I got tired of being used and abused by the private sector in NY. I decided to do something with meaning. Something where I couldn't be fired just because...,We don't get hardly any free time/ personal time.,You have no free time in BCT,Just give us more free time
To use the opportunities it provides as a way to prepare my life once I get out and I've always loved the military environment since 6th grade,"Not really, so far I've been having a very good experience the only thing I would want to change would be things like the water only being hot but that's not really something that applies rn",It burns when you take a shower,Call a water treatment guy or something
2003,Delta,No comment,Not really
"Open opportunity, I really didn't know what to do after highschool","It went well, we had our ups, we had our downs, but it the end we came together as a team. ",I don't wish it would've been done differently,No
To help me get into a better career field,Yes.  The shredded rubber tires are sharp.  I wish we did pt in the grass,I don't w,No
I thought it would be a good opportunity for my future ,There isn't anything I found too bad,The first two week is a more strict version of rotc,Not sure 
Because its was this or college and i got a 17 on the act,My drill sergeants were more teaching then yelling and helped out idk about other ones,They were nice and caring ,
For the student loan repayment programs & other benefits ,Maybe have some of the trainees have the documentation needed before hand. ,,
2002,Other than that everything is what it should be,Do not bring things that are on the list because you will have to buy them anyways,No...Just dont make people waste money...not everyone can afford it
Family an benefits,Since were in yellow phase which is like a quarantine I think we should have just a little more phone time before we start actually trying,,
To protect my loved ones and benefits for college,I wish I would have been able to stay in contact with family more and tried to stay in shape more as well,Just by telling them to talk with their family instead of being in the phone so much and also to just get up and do something ,Try and be open to new people
College,No,Don't go to basic,Give us our phones at personal time
Free education ,Sitting outside on the floor with my food while bugs crawl on my food is annoying ,Sitting outside on the floor with my food while bugs crawl on my food is annoying ,Bring us to the Dfac 
I wanted to serve my country and become a doctor,More in depth briefings of the tasks at hand. ,A more defined list of instructions,Different teaching approaches 
I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life so i decided to check the army out and i liked it a lot,When people are having real legitimate problems the drill Seargents say they are there to help but then they are scary to talk to and don't want to help you out,Drill  Seargents are not understanding to real life problems ,Just have them listen more to the trainees
I dont know honestly,It sucks but I and most other people said that's just how it is and went along with it,It sucks but you gotta do what they want you to do ,No
"Yes, Because is one of my dreams become a soldier and I want to be an air and marine agent for Homeland Security. Is part that I want to do in my live.",,,
I joined to serve my country and to create a good life for my fìance,,,
To make my family proud,Everything is fine as it,Everything is fine as it,No
For the college benefits and a chance to expand and see new places ,Lacking discipline pretty much. Like moving and talking in formation ,"The same way I explained it, I don't like to make things sound more difficult then it already is",
I wanted to fly and my brother was in and showed me there's big things past high school ,I wanted Frosted Flakes but there was zero cereal when it was my platoons turn to eat ,I want more cereal at chow ,Chow needs to get more cereal 
To make my parents proud and to start adulthood,I have nothing i wish had been different ,Bct is great and should stay the same,No thoughtd
For family,No,"I would say ""Work the hell out before you get here or else you'll suffer more than you have to""",No not really 
2003,"I'd like to call my family more and talk more, ",I would say that talking to family having more calls would help in a sense of having family to talk to,
I like to serve and be seen as a leader,I like to adopt to changes and it is ok so far,Proceeding to BCT ensure that you have clear mind and be positive at all times,No
To better myself from going down the wrong path,Smoke cigarettes and sat on the couch all day,Don't smoke or sit on the couch ,Quit smoking when I get out of basic and keep active 
2003,No ,I would tell them it's good and not bad ,Change nothing 
To set up my future either in the Army or out of it. Also to make my parents and friends proud,The tenacity of it. Switching from high to low was physically and mentally taxing. I wish it were more in the middle most of the time with personal time being the low.,There is a lot going on that doesn't make sense and your supposed to act like it's ok. having more explanation about why and what we were doing would have been beneficial,fix the recruiting process. give truthful info about basic. many people will arrive at basic like i did. and not expect much but then get a harsh awakening. i thought about quiting because i didn't think i could mentally handle it. i thought about how my mos is vastly different to basic and that's helping me stay but it's very hard to stay motivated in a harsh environment 
2003,I think yellow phase was a good way to quarantine however the classes we participated in were very fast and we had very little time to truly fully understand what we were being taught. Maybe have more time to take notes.,More time to take notes,Just adding more time for notes. Less latrine breaks? 
My family is in a financial situation and we don't have enough money for home and I want to go to college,When the Drill Sergeants tell us about the M4's and make us learn everything in a short period of time and then have a test the next day. We should have things like homework to understand it better,It's should me a little more like school and they give us homework's they can help the people that doesn't understand the material ,Give us homework to help the people that doesn't understand the material 
To pay off student loans.,"I understand basic training is meant to be difficult, so the only thing I would change is the amount of information given beforehand. It would've been nice to know I'd spend a week at reception before BCT, that I'd be quarantined for two weeks before BCT really started, and it would be really nice to know what happens after graduation before AIT. Do I get days off? Can I go home? Can my family visit? I'm married and AIT is 32 weeks, will I get to see my husband? More information would've been appreciated.","I'd like a better timeline, more information as to what to expect during this process.","I don't know. Either the recruiters/drill sergeants don't know, it changes, or no one is willing to share information. Maybe it keeps trainees on edge and helps make us comfortable being uncomfortable. ",Give future soldiers a better timeline before they ship.
2003,"So far things are going fairly well, drill sergeants should be more patient when explaining how to use new equipment ",So we were in rifle training and a few drill sergeants were showing us how to do the standing positions and 1 was getting a little impatient were as other were taking there time and getting depth ,No 
03/01/2003,3-34,Delta company ,We hope that COVID 19 gets lifted so we could have a lot of hands on training 
I wanted to change the path I was taking in life as well as I didn't exactly feel like I wanted to go to college as well as set me up for my future ,The first 2 weeks were mainly just sitting in a classroom going over rules and regulations and that's it I would try to add more hands on ways of teaching to keep people more engaged ,Make sure that classes you give people isn't just hours of note taking and paperwork make more hands on learning if possible ,I think hours of lecture cause people to get bored causing hands on learning to be implemented to get more people engaged and intrigued by the lesson ,Not have so much paperwork involved in the teaching process 
1990,"No, not really.",Everything has been as I expected in BCT. ,No!
Family tradition ,Wished to have learned about land navigation in those 2 weeks due to running out of things for them to teach us outside of our company area.,First 2 weeks will be boring just few classes on safely for the m4 and a lot of pt and cleaning ,Maybe to show them some videos on some firefights or something for them to see how serious it is that they give 110% 
1994 ,I wish that we would have be at our company instead of having to switch buildings after the 2 weeks ,That during yellow phase they had us stay at another company for the first 2 weeks of basic ,No 
Education benefits and free housing once i get married to my fiancé ,I wanna be bigger ,I want to be in better shape,No
To pay for college,"To get tables to eat on, and to not wear masks,  if you join the odds are you are not at risk for covid it makes no sence",Sense,Letting us remove mast if we are vaccinated
A career and to travel the world. ,"Towards the end of yellow phase, it was very repetitive, and the food was very bland not much flavor. ","They're trying to drill the information into your head. For the food it was just huge portions to cook for I guess, but still add seasoning. ",Not sure. 
,,,
2001,I think it's perfect,In some cases ,Not sure 
I joined so I can travel the world and give my girlfriend a life that she never had but so very much deserves ,With yellow faze closer to the end of it there was really nothing to do but think and every time I started think I just got my self down and wanted to go home ,That this stuff ain't easy and if you start getting in your own head it's hard to get out oh it ,Letting tranies use the windows to let sun light in 
Anderson Indiana,Moving to our actual battalion got postponed ,Not that big of a deal but we didn't know what to really do for 2 days,No
I plan to make it my career until I retire.,"It was not completely clear what items were needed versus what items were not, as well as how many of each was required of the necessary items. A list for each individual would correct the problem.","Lists of items needed during any shopping, packing or other trips would make everyone's lives easier.",None that I have not said already.
"I joined for education benefits, travel, challenges, and new experiences",I wish we had colder more accessible water to fill our camel backs with,It would be nice to have cold water easily accessible in our sleeping area,No
Education,,,
A good future/ career ,Just a rough idea of what our day will look like for example what classes we'll be learning or what we'll be doing for pt and if we have any briefs then the briefs and there times  ,Just give the recruits a schedule of what there day would be like ,Give the recruits a schedule or outline of there day 
2003,"More outdoor training whether it's marches, runs for PT, just getting outside and doing more I felt very bored over the past 2 weeks ",Less classroom time and more outdoor time,"It's very boring the first 2 weeks, you don't do much outside the classroom and joining the army you would expect to be doing stuff not just doing a whole lot of waiting and nothing besides studying and eating",More activity's during yellow phase 
"Free school, learn better time management and discipline. Also get in better shape.",2nd platoon delta company ,,
1999,I would like to change the way the drill shots think ,"They believe that yelling in your face will get a task done faster which is not the case like for example when it came to studying "" you didn't remember you special orders, do push ups."" As if that will help you learn ",Telling the drill sgts to change there tactics to help improve a solider not in just a physical way but help them actually learn 
Nj*,Delta company ,No I don't ,No 
To serve my country and give myself and my girlfriend a better life ,Make it seem less boring so that it doesn't seem so long ,It was boring and felt really long,Give us more interesting classes to learn about 
I decided to join the army because I can't go to college due to lack of money and also I want to enhance my English speaking and listening skills ,I can't think of any that have to be done differently. All of the Drill Sergeants are doing great to discipline and help us to accomplish this journey until graduation. Everything is fine for me. ,I would explain that everything/everyone are just doing the way it/they should be doing. ,No 
"Father was in the army, brother is currently serving, felt obligated to. Also I didn't want to go to college.",Well since reception there has not been a lot of problems. Everything I have expected to go on has happened. And nothing I can think of should be changed. ,Everything here is what I expected. ,None. 
Money ,There was always at least one thing broken at one time like a toilet or a locker,There was at least one toilet stuck on flushing or a locker that just didn't open or close properly. ,Have someone regularly check on the state of the bays and anything in them. 
My home is 714 Lee Ave,2nd platoon,Delta company ,1 hour of phone time
To prove to my peers that I'm not the underdog,There hasn't been anything I wish had been done differently everything made sense ,It's the summer camp with physical training and rifle marksmanship incorporated into the days,
I wanted to serve my country and make a good life for myself ,The masks almost made me pass out because of how hot it was so if there is a heat cat 4 or 5 you shouldn't be required to wear a mask,If it's really hot you don't have to wear a mask,Not having people wear masks outside 
I wanted a purpose ,Nothing ,Join if you want ,No
I decided to join for a better life for myself and my family.  I wanted to find a path in life and I figured the Army would get me on a straight path. ,Most trainees that I've noticed want this experience to be a holiday getaway. I understand it's supposed to be tough on your mind and body and I accept that. ,Basic training is meant to turn a civilian into a soldier. And the life of a soldier is different from regular people and so the process to change the mindset of a civilian that has been doing thing a certain way for their life is and will be tough. ,"No, everything good on my side. "
Yes because I have issues,I want to go home,No ,No
Schooling ,Time management. Making sure that the drill sergeants have the correct time and we won't have to sit around till we get the news of the time. ,Not having the times switch up so much,Make sure the drill sergeants are on the same page as the people making the plans
I joined the army in order to set a better example for my younger brothers.,The only thing that I can think of is receiving more food. With all the working out I feel that the amount of food we get sometimes is not enough. ,"In BCT, we do a lot of physical exercises which can lead to exhaustion and a bigger appetite. We should have snacks in between meals like snack bread or a nature valley bar to fuel us back up from the physical workout ",More food throughout the day
College and wanted to get my life on the right track,,,
"So I could protect my siblings,  and my girlfriend",No,I dont know,
2003,Not get COVID,I wish that I didn't take the COVID shot that made me test positive on the COVID test and therefore I had to go to ISOFAC (COVID BAY),Don't test people that took their first COVID shot
So my future kids can live  comfortably ,I wish I was more mentally trained  and I wish there were some things that I knew about that my other peers did before they came here ,Do the online training  to get a rank up before you come in so u have more of a motivation to stay,
Home is romeoville Illinois. I was born at the year of 2002,I wish I could talk to those that are important to me more often. Mails take long to send and receive ,I wish I had more time to talk to both sides of my family and my friend ,Have a day for phone time so people can have longer time to talk to their love ones instead of being rushed 
2003,I wish we did more to like get us ready for the 2 mile run since I struggle a lot with endurance ,I would say you should work on endurance to be ready for the exercise event at the end of BCT,Maybe just give us more or different types of running exercises like running up the hill
I joined the army because to be honest I had nothing else for me I would probably have died due to violence so I wanted to better myself and also grow wit different opportunities that come my way,Not really sure everything is good ,Well this place makes u become more disciplined the drill srgents are very wise at there job and are there to help there trainees grow and to become stronger,No
2002,I wished I didn't broke down ,I can't go through BCT anymore ,I wish to go home 
2002,Delta,Better food,Nothing
To provide a better life for myself and my wife,If everyone were to stand and go over things line by line together it might help people learn things better,Exactly as described,Changing the way drill sergeants train classroom information
Student loan repayment ,It's been okay so far considering it's basic ,I would say it's basic training and learn to suck the suck ,Stop changing the way the army works 
Ohio,3,Delta,Its just covid
Why not,"I had a really great senior drill sergeant, senior drill sergeant spreen ",I had a really great teacher ,Have a better system for picking drill sergeants
I joined the army so I can get paid to learn about Information Technology(IT). ,I think I should've have improve on my leg tuck. ,Yes. ,Workout before you go to BCT 
To help pay for college ,There wasn't enough time to eat a lot of the time,In basic training we only get 15 minutes to eat and sometimes it's not enough ,Give people 25 minutes to eat 
1993,"Hope the Drill Sergeant Spreen can treat us not like monkey at the Zoo. Punishing us and acts like having fun at the same time, count the number insanity quick while doing V-up exercise like no one can reach that speed. ","A few Drill sergeants are crazy and need mental check, be careful and think triple before you sign the contract. ",Two reasons. The first reason is that trainees haven't met the standards. The second is that Drill Sergeant Spreen hates us and wants to make fun on us. ,Company commander patrols often to ensure trainees can learn in a safe environment instead of being torture by Drill Sergeant for fun
"Family tradition, and I wanted to for a long time",There is nothing really to improve on that I can think of,"Everything went relatively well, and most things were well planned","Make sure drill sergeants aren't always pushing to destroy all of the trainees, but also he cool and help them"
"I wanted a daily routine, and college money.",Establishing a few basics of left and right facing exercises and marches. Also giving pictures of the exercises and stretches would make it easier to remember.,Giving pictures of the stretching and exercises would help me remember it.,I have no ideas or thoughts.
College ,No,It's fine,Yup
Bremerton Washington ,334,Nothing it was perfect ,Nothing it was perfect 
I was born in 2003,"Some of the time that we spent standing around, or waiting I felt we could have been doing PT or studying or had possibly more free time.","In between either classroom time, or waiting to get breakfast lunch or dinner was long and uneventful, whereas if we had other things to prepare or help us increase strength or other aspects",Not really
3-34th ,Going to more different places,More marches around fort Jackson ,
I want to become a pilot,"It makes it more difficult to learn the classroom material, because you don't have any hands on learning at the same time","Say you start a new job, for training they give you a manual on what to do, and you have to read that manual for two weeks, but you can't apply any of the information in the manual to your new job yet because you have to finish reading the entire manual first, instead of reading then applying immediately.",
2001,I can't think of anything that I wish was done differently,That it can be a little fun but lots of training involved to get in shape for whatever MOS a person picked and if they chose to go Airborne,None at all
1989,Should be just one vegetable. You should be able to get 2 ,At reception we got the chance to get unlimited vegetables but at yellow phase it was limited ,Nothing else 
Michigan ,3,The building ,Just keep doing surveys

To get a head start to life. Get to travel and to challenge myself ,There wasn't enough cleaning supplies to clean our bays and bathroom ,Very little supplies was givin ,Be more organized 
Wanted to help out my family and wanted the benefits that came with it,I want to try the different kind of mres,Get to eat more of the meal ready to eat,Nothing
The main reason was that I need money for college.,"I was only issued three outfits for PTs. One of my pairs of shorts got stolen or lost. It has been difficult, if not impossible, to rotate between two pairs of shorts and stay clean. ",I was not given enough clothes for our physical training and had to wear the same clothes multiple days in a row.,"Have a way to ensure against stealing, issue more PT's, or give the option early on to buy more clothes (specifically PT's.) "
I don't have a reason just walked in and joined ,I have no changes to recommend except maybe phones on personal time but that won't happen,No change needed ,No
Nevada ,3,D Co,"During reception there was a lot of spare / waiting time, where as it could've been beneficial to cover things we would need to know for yellow/red phase ","Reception was made up of a lot of paper work , a lot of which was coveted during meps"
2002,Nothing ,BCT is a great experience to go through for people who want actual change in their lives ,No
College benefits ,Tired as fuck falling asleep in class ,Feels like everything's a dream ,no
To change my life around. Also because I have been wanting to be a chef in the military for a long time. I also wanted help paying for school. ,The bays are really cold and we aren't allowed to sleep in anything except for our summer PT's. The two blankets we get don't help. I don't want to get sick because of how cold it is. ,The bays are really cold but you can only sleep in you physical training uniform. You can't violate the uniform. ,No
It's a family tradition ,Everything went smoothly and mostly how I expected it to. I don't have any real complaints or concerns ,I would say basic training is like a really intense football camp,No I dont
Wilton North Dakota ,Try to make reception faster by getting all of my gear together and organized,When you head to reception know where all of your items and personal belongings are,No
To get out of my little bubble at home by doing something that will take me completely out of my comfort zone. And also to challenge myself while receiving educational benefits and a jumpstart to my career at the same time,"These last few days, outside of morning pt and supplemental pt, the days mainly consisted of a lot of waiting and I wish there had been more activities like more rifle marksmanship training or more dnc training",I wish we spent more time training on a lot of major aspects of bootcamp so that way our time would be more wisely distributed,Shortening reception 
"I joined so I could be more independent, pay for my schooling and travel more. Also to meet more people and get experiences in the real world ","We would finish pt, be sweating and go on in the entire day wearing dirty sweaty clothes. Also we only get issued three sets of PT's and it's not enough for the week and we just waste detergent ",We finish doing physical exercise in the morning and we have to go the whole day in sweaty black clothes and when we go into the classrooms they smell because we don't change our clothes or have time to showe ,The drill sergeants need to be lenient 
Family tradition,It is harder to cool down drinking warm water ,In the army we train from early in the morning to the evening ranging from regular workouts to events which mostly take place outside. Especially during the summer  cycles in Fort Jackson there is a lot of heat and humidity so adding ice to our water would help cool our internal temperate which would help decrease the number of heat casualties.,At morning formation collect bags of ice for the platoons then have them put ice in their bags
Incentives and to make my family proud,Yellow phase is supposed to be a time to quarantine be we couldn't even keep the facility properly disinfected ,I wish cleanliness and supplies were more of a priority,No
"I decided to join because it's a family tradition, I've been around it all my life and would love to live the military life and be part of it, my entire life was based around it, and I would like to serve my country",One thing I wish could've been done different was a lot more time to learn the creeds and all the introductory things before learning the actual marching and formations and things as such,"It would be a lot easier to learn all the sayings that explain your own personal role of a soldier, the ranks, the higher ranking personnel that run certain areas of bases for example (brigade commander)",The drill sergeants are too focused on preparing for the competitions instead of getting trainees prepared for their soldier careers unlike the competition,Making drill sergeants focus on getting trainees ready for the BCT and the military by getting the info of people and things into their head
"A lot of reasons, wanted to ever since I was little. Just always wanted to be a warrior and be on the front lines serving my country and fighting for whats right and the people I care about. I've always tried to live my life being as selfless as possible so what better a way to be selfless than to serve in the Army.",I wish we didnt have to put important paperwork in bags and throw them around and have them get all wrinkled up. It makes us look very unprofessional and I'm going to need that important paperwork after Basic Training.,"They made us throw our inportant paperwork about our contract, benefits, payment, medical imformation, etc. in laundry bags and duffel bags and we had to throw a bunch of other stuff in those same bags and carry them around various places and throw them in the back of trucks to be moved from place to place and the important paperwork got very wrinkled and disheveled. It made the papers look like they were carelessly thrown into a bag with other stuff like a child because they were which looks very unprofessional.",I guess maybe give us a binder or something or something to protect important paperwork other than a laundry bag or duffel bag.
1999,Not really. Everything was fine. ,"Be positive, prepared to wake up early, be on time, do exercises, and never give up. ",
To help others,I believe that BCT is fine the way it is,BCT has gotten nicer than it was a few years ago,Not really
Looked like fun,No,Wait in the heat,Pray
2003,More time to study and more personal time,More time to learn the army chain of command,No
29 beach street revere MA 02151,No ,It's a good time just hard physically and mentally ,No
I joined because of the benefits and I would leave at age 39 if I do the full 20 years allowing me to have 2 degrees and have a job I always wanted which is designing video games,Like what changes that were since the pandemic or what we should study before going to BCT.,Like elaborating on what we need to be studying and should be working on like workouts,
2003,,,
I was born on 130703,It was okay ,It is hard,Keep moving forward 
Family tradition ,No,Tradition has it's purpose ,Idk
To have a better future for myself,I'm being medically discharged and haven't trained,I am hurt and am no longer going to be in the army,Nope
,,,
For college ,Our showers in the bays only has cold water ,We only have cold showers ,No
To make a change in my life and get a start,I like my experience so far,The physical part isn't as hard as you would think and the information isn't that hard just study,That's about all
I join to make my family proud ,It would be good if we had more sleep for that time ,During the first 3 days it's hard to get any sleep ,No
"I didn't want to go to college, but I didn't want to be a bitch. I joined to physically and mentally improve myself",...,...,No
I joined so I could not only better myself but so I could also  get a good college degree without paying most if not all the cost,"No there is nothing I would want done differently, the drill Sergents that I have been under have honestly been one of if not the best ones around ",Everything is fantastic,No
To get a bachelors in engineering ,4th platoons bay hasn't had hot water since day 0 of basic training ,There is no hot water in the showers ,Getting a plumber to fix the boiler 
"For the college, travel, benefits, and to make my family proud ","Hot showers, our showers are freezing cold. I thought that was normal but another bay said they only get hot showers. Also the masks are annoying.",I wish we didn't have to wear masks and I wish we had hot showers ,"No just fix it, it's brings down morale and causing a weaker immune system."
"Honor, and to serve a cause greater than mine. ",The showers are cold. We haven't had hot water since day one. And we only have around 10 mins to eat. Excluding time needed to clean and dump trash. It's way to short of a time window to eat a meal in ,The showers are cold. We haven't had hot water since day one. And we only have around 10 mins to eat. Excluding time needed to clean and dump trash. It's way to short of a time window to eat a meal in ,"Fix the water heater, and make chow time longer "
Stability,Sergeants,The reception of Basic training is unorganized ,Making reception more scheduled
It's a family tradition and to pay for college,"The website that was used had varieties but if I were to choose, I would have liked to have streamed my home town church that I could have found on line. ",Allow the trainees to suggest other websites to stream our religious services,Allow trainees to share suggestions of how they would watch their religious services when on an electronic device 
To help pay for college and to make myself a better person,The first 3 days of reception we waiting around almost all day and only did a few things ,Basically the drill sergeants make you get somewhere at a certain time then you have to wait a few hours to actually do whatever it is they rushed you to do,No
to become strong physically and mentally ,when we go to take a shower the water is ice cold,when we go to take a shower the water is ice cold,someone needs to pay the water bill
No,Are you asking what I wish had been done differently or what I personally could have done differently,?,
For a better future ,As in how I was before i came i like the changes of my lifestyle now,It's life changing,It's all good
I did not wanna go to college along with following the family footsteps,"Like we get 15 mins to eat like all the other platoons, and we have to have all the garbage out. Eating all the food in under that time takes time to adapt, and we just hopped right in it",So,Make the feast times longer
I believe that the army is the best route to complete my goals,I feel like a lot of time was wasted during PT Trying to cater more towards beginners rather than trying to improve the company as a whole,Lowering the standards of your training so that others could catch up,I'm not sure because I know we need to complete this as a team and the only way of fixing this would be to split everyone up and that shouldn't happen
To start a career for myself ,My experience has been going pretty well so far for the most part ,Everyone's experience will be different at BCT but you make the best of it in your own way and try your hardest and push yourself ,No
College Benefits ,I felt like things has been going well and I feel a huge difference with myself,I feel a huge difference physically and mentally where it was an improvement. I would change a thing of how they run things ,
I want to be remembered like my dad is and I want to help people,Right when we got here there was so much yelling. I think if we were lowered slowly into it all we'd feel better about our decisions ,BCT was super hectic and chaotic the first two weeks,"Not really, no"
To serve my country,I am always hungry and food is always on my mind. I can't focus,You don't eat that much food in basic. You burn more calories than you eat,Only MREs or someone else serve food
I wanted to give myself the opportunity to have a good life ,I just would have like to be able to talk to my mom and dad and my loved ones more so I would have had the security of knowing that everything is okay ,Phone calls home really help ease your mind and it's would be awesome if you could have done it more over the first couple weeks for sure ,Nightly phone calls would be awesome but I get that it's a privilege to have them now so it's alright 
To show my parents and grandma that I can be as tough as my grandpa that passed away 15 days before I shipped off,Training for the ACFT more to improve on the events . Also in yellow phase wearing mask I would have like to have more then two mask I was sweating through them and wearing a wet mask ,Having more then two mask to switch from during the day and more training days for the ACFT,When we get are Black and Tan mask maybe give out two or three more of each 
Because I was getting kicked out of my home and needed job security,My run time is terrible,I would tell them the acft is really hard for me to pass,I'm taking my iron pills and my birth control to help me stay regulated with iron and my periods
To be able and afford farther education ,To being able and be more confident on answering questions and participating more ,Having confidence on what you're doing and carrying yourself too,By participating more and be more confident on myself 
"To try a new experience, something that I would be proud to be apart of and get out my comfort zone ","When we ran I didn't keep pushing myself to keep
My heart rate up because I'm
Not used to
That for example ","I would say to
Push yourself outside your limits and try your hardest ","Push yourself past your physical
Limits to succeed in even if it's physically difficult for you "
I joined because I didn't wanna go to college and wanted to help my family financially ,I wish I had pushed myself more physically throughout the workouts and training we have done over the last 2 weeks ,I would say that I didn't motivate myself or push myself enough to get better in training ,I hope to somehow motivate myself more and hope that my battle buddies will be there too also motivate me to keep pushing through to the end 
I decided to join the Army for college tuition and to get more discipline ,"I want to do good on my ACFT, so I'll do more training to achieve that ",I would tell them to at least exercise and get psychically in shape to do good,"Yes, to improve and add in more training "
To have a steady job and to make my parents proud,There is nothing,There is nothing,No because there's nothing to fix
"I always wanted to serve, the benefits and  college","Since I've been here, I've learned to expect nothing and learn discipline. I feel like my learning and training has been facilitated adequately ","I do my job, the drill sergeants do theirs. If I mess up, I get messed up. I'm here to train.",The respect that I am given from my drill sergeants and my battle buddies. They see me and treat me as an adult and I am held to that standard.,I am going to continue to work my hardest and strive to do my best at everything. I am going to continue motivating myself and battle buddies
And I was born in 2002,Work out more,Work out a lot cause it will be easier for you ,It's not enough 
I decided to join the army because I wanted to be more disciplined and grow as a person mentally and physically ,"I wish that in the beginning when I arrived that they would understand why I couldn't find my bag . When I did the drill sergeants from 1st platoon I believe said that is wasn't mine and I shouldn't have touched it . However that is in the past and I don't really seem to see how I could have ever change that . I also wish that they let us use our civilian underwear that of course is neutral colors  abiding the rules of the company. However they made me put them in my personal bag, never to be used ",They aren't very good listeners and more pushy because of their duty . ,Not really . There's nothing much I can do. 
"To protect the nation, become a more confident and stronger person",I feel that the methods of how the drill Sergeants teach and how the living standards is just fine the way it is.,"The way how the drill sergeants teach is to instill  discipline and teach the army values to the trainee. The living standards is going to be different from your life at home. You are going to have to share the same bathrooms, and you are going to have to cooperate with your bay mates.",
I wanted to learn more about technology and I grew up in a military base back in my own country ,It's too cold in the bay,And most of my platoon members are sick,And hard to shower with cold water
To follow in a family members footsteps and make him proud ,Everything done in the last 2 weeks was done in a good manner and was educational. While at sometimes it was stressful and confusing I learned what to do. ,"We as trainees learn what our environment is. Our drill sergeants, bay, battle buddies, pt pit, and what we will be doing.",The army has a system that all trainees go through to get then what to do. This is caused by the chain of command building this system to help trainees to become soldiers.  ,To be better at telling us what to do 
I needed to make a change in my life,I wish there was a milk alternative for breakfast and healthier options for food during the yellow phase,They don't have vegan/vegetarian options for food,Taking a survey on what people eat during reception week
Job qualification,There's no hot water,There is no hot water ,Not sure 
To change the world. ,"Rubber ducky's, or mock weapons to go along with the RM classes ","We are taught to aim, carry a weapon, weapon discipline, and more without the weapon reaching our hands for at least a considerable amount of classes. A mock weapon could instill early trigger discipline, and flagging discipline in a way that is completely safe. ","As stated previously, mock weapons, or for when we learn maps, those little dark green plastic figurines for trainees to move around the map to better understand navigation "
"I joined the Army for the opportunity to start a new chapter in my life, travel, and free college ",I knew there would be times I was going to hate being here and be out of my comfort zone which is fine    ,BCT is NOT for everyone but if you want to better yourself I suggest you sign up ,No I don't 
Yes,Les bay maintenance for the females when our drill Sergent was busy with a million things. Maybe have more drill Sergent help out when one is out sick,Basically we were ordered on endless bay maintenance duty even when we did everything we were supposed to do cleaning wise ,I'm not sure but when there's only one drill Sergent on one platoon they are left with millions of things to do and little time for us which makes our learning and training time hectic,Have more drill Sergent pitch in when one is out on sick leave
Always wanted to ,No hot water in the bay showers,,
Pay for School ,The showers are cold ,"The showers are cold , freezing cold ",No
I dont think I would be prepared to face the world as an individual as soon as I got out of high school (lack of experience and social skills) so I thought I'd gain that through the Army,"So far, it seems like we have had everything we needed. Pt has been good, learning and getting used to customs and courtesies has gone smooth as well. I like how our drill sergeants talk to us as people. I can't say much should be changes as these first 2 weeks haven't been eventful","We get the exercise we need, maybe a bit more since I always feel hungry despite seemingly eating a lot. Being taught how to address people of higher ranks has been straightforward as well. Overall, we haven't been doing any ""real"" training aside from classroom material and exercise","Not really. I get that yellow phase is supposed to be ""less active"" than the other upcoming phases so I think it's fine"
To better myself and to get the discipline i need to be an adult,I wish I would have worked out more and got in better shape.,It is physically hard and demanding here,warning people ahead of time to get in shape and drink water.
I wanted to make a change and live up to expectations,"The showers in the bay are freezing and the air conditioning in the bay is the same, it's constantly cold until you get outside",Prepare for nothing in-between it's hot and it's cold,Make sure the people tasked with the job are actually working to the fullest of their abilities
I joined to better myself and my future,There is nothing to elaborate on everything is good,"I would say "" the first couple weeks of BCT is tough but an amazing experience """,No everything is great
I've always wanted to and also wanted to follow in my dad's footsteps,"The hot water isn't working in bay 2B (and several other bays) and with it being super cold in the bays, cold showers were terrible ",The hot water wasn't working and I hated taking cold showers,All I have been told by drill sergeants is that it is broken and they have had someone come out to fix it and the person who fixes it says it's fixed but there's still no cold water,Still no hot water
2003 ,I don't have anything In mind I would want done differently. & also um I would say To serve my country and be able to help others & for the benefits as in for ,college also for a better future here at basic I've decided I want to go to college.  ,Nothing 
To help out with college and my family ,I would've prepared with knowledge ,"Learn your soldiers creed, the general orders, chain of command, and the exercises.",Study website or study material to help out.
I was previously in the Air National Guard and after completing my enlistment I did a conditional release to join the Army so that I could do a certain MOS. ,I was stuck in Covid Bay for the last two weeks so I haven't been in normal basic training ,I just re-entered Basic Training today ,All clear 
"I decided to join the Army because I wanted to enjoy the traveling experience, serve for the country and get benefits as well.","Instead of waiting and going inside every two seconds, I feel like we should of did something more productive other than continuing to do the same thing over and over again.",We had to go out of our bays just to go back in and clean right after we had just cleaned ,Have everyone come in vaccinated already and have them screened and tested for COVID
To pay for college,"The female platoon fell behind with the classes, so when we joined our real platoons we didn't know as much as them",I would tell them we would do other stuff instead of being in the classroom ,Everyone should be wearing a mask
2003,"Women are very underrated and we come last in almost everything, they also doubt our abilities & think of us as weak not everybody but most of everybody",Women are underrated & we get poor treatment as women,treating women equally and giving them opportunity to prove themselves 
"To better myself and bring out the inner Warrior that is inside of me. Also, to get a good start in my adult life.","Everything here has been a great experience and everything the Drill Sergeants and other high ranking officials have provided have been very beneficial, simple,efficient and affective ",The people here have helped out a lot and makes sure that everything is in order for you. They makes sure you are safe and are getting the right training. ,No I do not 
"I want to start a family and be able to take care of them, as well as be a part of something I will be proud of","When we go out to exercise, I understand we can slip the mask off slightly, but it goes back and forth if we can or not, and it makes it difficult to breathe and perform optimally with a mask on your face. The gloves make it difficult to perform as well, I understand the reasoning behind these decisions, I just don't enjoy it as well as other trainees",The mask mandate makes BCT frustrating and sluggish ,Making designated time and places for trainees to get fresh air 
To pay for college I want to be a doctor one day so I wanted to have my bachelors already paid for so I wouldn't have too much dept for medical school ,Well a lot of thing were different because of COVID so not really everything is just running slow because of it. The only thing I didn't like how it was run was 120th but because I didn't sleep for like 40 ish hours ,So when u first arrive to get all your check ups. They didn't let us sleep for basically 2 days but other than that I have nothing to complain about ,You can't change COVID so nothing 
I wanted to challenge myself to become part of an organization that is truly revered,"Drill sergeants expected trainees to fully understand the customs and courtesies so quickly, leaving us little time to adjust",The military culture is hard to adjust to ,More flexibility from the drill instructors
To get my life started ,Not waiting around as much as we do,We were standing around a decent bit at a time ,Nope
to start my career path ,Wearing masks while conducting PT is very difficult ,working out outside in the heat is hard to do while wearing a mask,making the vaccine mandatory and having people get tested for covid before they arrive 
To be like my father,I think everything's been done pretty well.,Everything done so far has been done in pretty good way,Nope
I wanted to better myself and I wanted to go to college. ,Due to having to be apart our company wasn't able to exercise together very much,Covid sucks but it's all good ,No 
I joined to help support my family ,I didn't like having to wear a face mask while working out,Wearing a face mask made it difficult to breathe while exercising ,No not really 
"To Chang my future, an to jump start my career ",I mean getting more chance of gaining extra time to use your phone ,Like if you get good times on your testing scores and or physical testing then you and 5 people can get randomly pick to gain extra phone time ,I think we just need more time to conduct personal hygiene and sleep. 
2002,Like being able to have more opportunities to be able to earn more phone time like doing a specific task ,"I would say that in BCT we can earn a privilege of using our phones but no more than 30 minutes every Sunday, I would like more time to be able to use my phone by Doing certain task like making my bed the right way or doing good for a PT session ",The drill Seargants can take away our phone usage during basic but they haven't been able to give any more time for phone usage only taken it away ,I can probably ask the drill Seargants to be Able to give out more phone time 
I joined because i am in the rotc program and I was struggling on pt so I can to pass that to get back ,I don't understand  the last question ,"Questioned “Switching gears, I'm hoping to improve the training you went through these last 2 weeks. With that in mind can you think of one thing you wish had been done differently?”",We need to improve on the mrs because they are really not good which is not good but so far basic training is okay  
College money and AIT credits.,"I want more time blocked off for personal hygiene and sleep. Since there are so many members in the bay. It's hard to get everything, showers, laundry, etc done and still sleep a good amount of time.",There isn't very much time to shower or sleep so we are all tired and some of us smell.,Just take a rather small amount of time from multiple things and add an additional hour to the sleep time.
I wanted a good foundation ,"Well, since I've been in yellow phase quarantining, there isn't much that the drill sergeants could do to make anything better",The first two weeks of BCT is basically a quarantine that lasts for two weeks before we can do anything fun,"Well, the only thing I could think of is getting rid of covid but that's unrealistic"
I wanted to be guaranteed a good job,I didn't work on my endurance enough so I get tired pretty fast during the PT sessions,I would tell them that working on endurance is very important because it doesn't matter if you're super strong if you run out of energy thirty seconds into an exercise,I think the workouts conducted at recruiting stations to prepare people for bct should be more difficult in order to give a better idea of what PT will be like in bct
The main reason I joined was because of college to be honest ,Well me and the battle buddies that I had didn't really get along for the first couple days cause some of us would argue over dumb things,Just try and get along with the people in your bay the best you can cause you'll be with them for the next 10 weeks ,Just make sure that everyone gets along even if they have big egos cause if they don't they're gonna cause a bunch of problems for everyone 
I think  it's a great way to start a foundation for a family also I love to utilize a lot of gi bills ,Most initiates need more inspiration I think that if the process was faster then both your sergeant and I miss you more incentive to kind of get the day over with ,Either shorten the days or cut them off and I think you'll find more inspiration between initiate and drill sergeant ,No 
It's a calling. It was something I wanted to do long time ago. I also joined it to have more opportunities. ,Like 15 minutes is too short. We need at list 20 to 30 minutes. ,We have 15 minutes to eat and we stand up after. No time to digest. It gave me something stomachache ,We just need more time to eat. That's all
To jump start my life and to start becoming an adult ,The food here has little to no flavor and i wish i could add flavors to the food i eat ,The food here is terrible so if there is any chance whatsoever add flavor to the food ,"No seasoning in the food and if there is seasoning its not enough to taste, the food can be very dry or very wet to the point where its dripping food thats not supposed to be wet or slimy ","Give the cooks more seasonings to put in the food, make the food almost how it would be in the civilian world. The food is damn near prison food "
For my family ,We got left alone in our bay for hours and we're told to conduct bay maintenance for all those hours and then the drill Severus would be like oh so and so didn't come and get you guys ,They would leave us and forget about us ,Get more help 
I joined because it paid for school and gave me a great job for my future,"I think with the circumstances for yellow phase, the best is already being done",It's boring and sucks but you just have to embrace the suck. It can always be worse. The Drill Sergeants are doing the best they can,No
Not your business ,,,
For the benefits and college ,Like all we did was March I wish we could have did actual combat training ,All we did was walk and do pt,By doing more fun stuff instead of just sitting around 
I joined to gain skills to transfer for a civilian job and because I wanted to serve my country to help prolong its life because I love my country,"Not really, however explaining how to use the heater more effectively in mre's would have helped me eat better and more normally throughout the first week",I don't know. I'd say that you don't need tons of water and that it takes less time then you think but I think it was more user error then product error although it isn't something most people think about trying to figure out to use ,Not really
To create opportunities for myself and independence ,"I'm finding things to be just as I expected, rather a bit different but around thing",There's nothing to really worry about just do what your told and work hard,No
"School, job experience, money, benefits, character improvement, and direction ",We do sprints and deadlifts and run a lot. It would be nice if my body had some fuel to run off of while doing all that. ,We workout before we eat breakfast in the morning and that makes it hard to bring maximum effort towards physical training ,Eat before high intensity workout so trainees can actually benefit from the exercise and be able perform through the whole workout 
Family ,I would change drill sergeants ,The mood of drill sergeants are crazy ,Bye Training people that is motivated 
I decided to join to better myself in my civilian job and to also be able to keep a family tradition of serving the country ,"Sure, some of the males are currently out of shampoo and laundry pods ",Along with soap ,Yeh let us go to the troop store 
To help my parents get their citizenship documents faster and to travel,"The whole first week was really hard, I really felt like quitting because I wasn't use to all this and I kept on putting myself down. I wish I could've just motivated myself at little bit more at the beginning.","Umm let's see, I would say that it's all a mental game, and to just keep on moving forward. ",no not really 
I decided to join to pay for college and to make a change in my life,"At times there was a lot of bay maintenance and and just waiting around in our bays, or outside because everyone seemed to be really busy. However, the drill sgts still managed to help us get everything done that we needed to get done","Even though it seemed like there was a lot of waiting around and not knowing what we were going to do next, the drill sgts still taught us fitness stuff and how to march when they got to us",Maybe the drill sgts could get more help?
2002,"Nothing to improve, I'm enjoying my time in BCT so far.","It's hard work, but at the end of every day you feel good, and know you're improving. Only if you're putting in 100% though.",No
To build a foundation for my family. ,"More drill sergeants to help the drill sergeants who are short staffed. Due to that, we were behind on briefs because in my platoon there was only one drill sergeant. She made ends meet, but more staff could of helped her a lot more.",More staff will help those who are short staffed.,Being able to have more drill sergeants in case 
To better myself to do cool things and to learn a trade,It went pretty smoothly ,The drill sergeant where pretty good at what they needed us to do ,No
I joined because I have always wanted to serve in the military and I wanted to do the army to make my family proud and to be apart of something big and to help others and I thought it looked fun to do,A drill sergeant would say one command and then another drill sergeant would say something different and would confuse the platoon and make them waste time,One teacher would tell the class to do one thing and then another teacher would come in the class and tell them to do something totally different and the class would not know what to do from there,Have a the instructors sit down with each other and plan out what they are going to do for the play 
I've wanted to serve my entire life. I don't have a specific reason. This life has always just called to me. ,I would say the workouts. They allow the males to workout before or after almost every meal but the females weren't given that opportunity even though all the Drill Sargent's say we need the most exercise,The males get to do more workouts than the females when the females are the ones that need to do the workouts more than the males ,Lack of Drill Sargent's. And the Drill Sargent's that are here don't want to deal with the females because some of us have bad attitudes,You can't fix other people's attitudes. They have to do that themselves. The only other idea I have is to send them home
To build myself up and better myself better than most,The drill seargents need to be more strict and hard on everyone and check more thoroughly to correct the hard-headed trainees ,Other than that I've loved it,They are just hard headed and don't really care. And in my opinion the drill sergeants should just be harder on the ones standing out and the ones that struggle should be helped more like first hand,Im just a trainee .. I don't have the knowledge to fix it
"I joined because one, college, and two, i come from a military family and i wanted to follow in their footsteps ","As a female, we were thrown around a lot on where to go and what to do. We were told a bunch of different things. And when our drill sergeants were gone, nobody really did anything with us. It took like 4 hours sitting in the bay for someone to come and get us finally ","When our drill sergeants were gone, we were left alone for a few hours and such to do nothing. And were tossed back and forth between directions a lot, so we got in trouble for doing what web were told",make the drill sergeants freaking talk to each other besides just gossiping and joking around. And actually fix stuff??? 
For my family ,We need to train a bit more,We needed more tactical training like with weapons,No
I joined because I wanted to start my career very early in life and start a life with my girlfriend very young,I wish that the phases and the dates they started were said in the beginning so it gives me something to push for and gives me a goal. ,Having a basic training schedule for the days before you get here. And a list of things you can bring bc the list that is out is very outdated and has changed a lot,Just get the word out when you first swear in
To help build my career and aid with college tuition ,The drill sergeants would give conflicting instructions at times because they had not communicated with each other or their schedules would be too busy which would cause less training ,The drill sergeants would give one instruction then the other drill sergeants would give an instruction that was the complete opposite of what was said,The drill sergeants for second platoon specifically have too much with on their plate and have to manage multiple jobs and training the trainees,Not sure 
I wanted to better myself and be a different person,Wait for a enlistment bonus,Get the best deal out of everything especially when your running and working out everyday.,Idk how to fix that
Benefits,Masks shouldnt be mandatory especially for vaccinated people,We have to wear a mask at all times and it's hard when it's hot and we exercise,Not require masks
"To support economically to my family in Mexico, and to study a career ",Yes,I should be more physically prepared for BCT,Train more after lights out with my battle bodies 
Benefits,The platoons not being separated,I wish the people at bct would all be together rather than separated in yellow phase,No
For my family and to better my living to not have to worry about certain things,I wish I would have started working out sonner and mentally prepare myself for how they were going to be trowards us,The amount of exercise that is being done is not a normal amount so being sore for days is okay but the main thing is when they screaming and telling you things is to tell yourself you can do things and motivate yourself of why you there ,There is nothing wrong with it it's just helping us 
I joined the army for my family and for college,"Just to have enough time to chew down food, without having a feeling I have to choke it down ","That you don't get enough time to eat your food, you have to choke it down.",Having someone in charge to  tell them to let us have more time to eat
To make my family proud and to get a head start in life,The drill sergeants shouldn't punish trainees for something that another drill sergeant asked them to do,The drill sergeants shouldn't punish trainees for something that another drill sergeant asked them to do,No
I decided to join because I wanted to travel the world and start my own business ,I wish the living condition was better and the way they carried out the training ,"Instead of them putting everyone together to train no matter the condition of breathing or injuries prior to basic they should place the trainees  in groups based on that
Example: people that have attitudes should be combined with similar people or people that run slow pace we should be mixed I feel that motivated the person ",No
College tuition ,"I wish that there were more Covid restrictions. For example, spacing out in the hallways, enforcing the trainees to wear their masks over their noses etc. ","I would tell them that there are four phases of BCT and the first is yellow phase. In yellow phase of basic training, all non vaccinated people have to take the","More social distancing, properly wearing the masks, and more sanitary stations. "
Benifits for me and my wife and to show her the world,Certain people dont give a shit and fuck up and everyone pays for what they did but not matter how much we al pay the one person still does the same shit over and over again. I think the one person that fucks up gets punished not everyone unless everyone isnt trying to fix it or get on that person.,Some people dont get a shit and dont try so  everyone pays for it ,And thats all
I joined to get my CDLs and stop working on the streets to make money . And i got a child and a fiancé so i needed a real job and the army was the best choice for me . ,Basically saying if i had more people on the outside or even if i was able to talk to my peoples/family more i would be more motivated then i am now . If they gave us more phone time or just time to talk to our family it would keep me more motivated.,I wouldnt really know how to asnwer that wuestion,No
My family and I wanted to better myself.,I'm more of a hands on person and it's hard for me to set through classes and retain all the information.,So we set through classes like in a high school class room setting and and go over different things like weapons stuff and standards and it was hard for me to retain the information ,Not right off 
To pay for college and better my future.,"Better explanation of what was to be studied for our yellow phase test, and better communication on what we are supposed to do when sent to our bays.","We were not fully communicated on what to do during some points during the day, due to having only one drill Sargent on for our platoon most days. ",Negative.
I'm on a military rotc scholarship to the university of north Georgia and I needed to join the military to qualify for the scholarship  ,"While the other platoons we're getting chow, we had to stand outside and wait for everyone to go through, while we could have been practicing our marching or something more productive ","We stood outside watching other people get their food for 30 minutes or so, and during that time we could have been doing something more productive like practicing our marching ",No
To set myself up for a better future and gain experience I wouldn't get anywhere else. Also pays for college and along with benefits ,Since covid limited training we would stay around for god knows how long and not do anything but classroom time.,It was not fun to do nothing or learn hands on ,No I do not 
I joined because I needed a job and wanted to leave my parent's house as soon as possible. ,"The bug spray mitigates bug, moisturizer is useful for dry skin, additional masks would prevent the two masks issues from getting to sweaty and smelly","BCT has its difficulties but I would personally recommend that you only bring bug spray, moisturizer and additional black (PT suitable) masks.",Add the items to the PX at Reception and let the trainees be able to purchase them 
I joined the army because of free college and the opportunity to stretch myself physically and mentally.,The drill sergeants can be a little strict but they are just doing their job and I appreciate them for that.,I would say that everything here at BCT is for a reason and even though the drill sergeants are rough they ultimately want you to succeed and why would they put in all this work if they just expect us to never make it.,No
I joined the army because growing up I was a army child and I always wanted to join the army and 've joined to get a better life and the the things I use to do growing up ,My two week experience was pretty nice in my opinion I really soundly chance anything ,Wouldn't change ,No 
2003,i wish we could have got straight into soldier training and the discipline was more harsh on the trainees as they require harder training to break bad habits,Becoming a soldier requires intense training and disciplinary correction to improve the mindset of the trainees before they become soldiers ,"If an action by a young trainee is committed more than once or it is seen that he is brining down the squad for his disciplinary actions, he should be corrected and kicked out "
Yes,I wish we could eat more food,"They feed us plenty every day, I'm just use to eating larger meals",Eat like a hungry dog when they give you food
To get paid while I'm in college ,I feel like there's that should be changed,"Basic training is basically getting you ready for the army, It's not hard you just gotta do what you're told.",No
To be able to provide for my family ,I wish that the punishments didn't seem so personal to the ones giving it out and be more about training and being a better person instead of someone's feelings hurt,Basically some will get in their feelings and we will get punished ,Maybe people not take stuff so personal and if they do not to give a punishment for it 
For a better life opportunity ,,,
1987,"So the drill sargeant do a perfect job with us, push us to get in discipline, be fitnes, clases are great.",Well all experience is particular. Some people like military live and other ones not. People who want to take this step need to be brave and determinate,"Not, sorry"
Travel and to help pay for college,I am unable to do a leg tuck which requires core and upper body strength which I don't have a lot of either. I feel like the drill sergeant was pressed for time when teaching study materials for us to know.,You will need to take any sorta note for study material in the classroom and workout whenever you can,No
I have two uncles that serve in the military and they motivated me to join. ,Being able to do the pt exercises better,Come prepared to deal with anything. Everyone has a different mindset and you have to work together as a team to make it threw. So come prepared in all aspects ,No that's something you learn when you get here
For college my family and also for my future job opportunities ,I needed to improve my pull ups and leg tucks and abs exercises ,Those are the thing I find quite difficult but I try to manage it ,Nothing else really 
I'm the oldest of 6 and wanted to set an example and also needed a foundation ,Well these guys been arguing like idiots and I've just been tryna be the peace maker. We've been smoked too many times ,I'll tell them that we've all had egos and just need to put them aside ,Red phase 
College ,"There's nothing that could improve, everything was like i expected ",BCT has nothing to improve ,No
To do something worth meaning and to have a better life,There is nothing that I wish that should've been done differently because it helped the transition from civilian to soldier easier,The first couple days were rough but it helped everyone get their discipline in order ,None at all the Drill Sergeants are doing a fantastic job
I joined to travel and meet new people. I want to experience the most I can. I also joined to make my family proud and to do what makes me happy.,Their is nothing that I wish would have been done differently it was a snotty transition the first 2 weeks ,Smooth*,No
Personal reasons only for myself to know,Everything was how I expected. I came to basic training with the knowledge it would be hard.,I don't know I guess just know that you mean nothing in basic training and you're transitioning from a civilian to a soldier so its gonna be hard.,Yeah call a plumber or someone with maintenance and fix the problem.
For educational benefits ,"I wanted to have journalism , but I didn't score high enough so I went with the first thing I saw with the least amount of years",Basically I didn't get to choose the job I wanted so I went for the easiest one,Have more jobs available 
I was born in 2003,Yes,It's hard but it has to happen,Nope
money future ,well its nothing i would do different ,its very mentally challenging but good training ,
"Many Reason, One of my dreams was to serve the US military at one point. 2nd I wanted to be the first in my family to serve in the US Military, 3rd, I wanted to Study Diesel Mechanic, but the classes were to expensive in college. I found out the Army had that job I wanted. Everything lined up for me with my goals, and Here I Am, in Basic Training in order to serve my country. ","I think Drill Sergeants should deal with trainees that are causing serious, unnecessary stress to other trainees. For Example, I have seen trainees trying to fight other trainees just because they're trying to correct the trainees that are doing wrong. ","I would tell them, ""Whenever a trainee is trying to help you/ correct you, don't take it personal. They're only trying to save you from getting smoked or the platoon or sometimes even company from getting smoked. ",no
To serve the country ,Yeah I'll rather go straight to red phase and learn through out the phase because I found yellow phase to be boring ,Instead of learning in a classroom    it would be better to learn through a hands on experience ,Getting rid off yellow phase
Benefits,We waited around a lot at reception,Everything else went well,Covid is a large problem.  Wear masks and wait for it to pass.  Vccines also
"I decided to join because I wanted to further my life. I did not focus a whole lot my last year of high school, but I knew that I loved media, like film and photography. So my MOS, 46S, was a perfect option for me in the guard, as I get to learn that job, as well as go to school to become an officer.","I think being allowed more time to train on our own, such as supervised individual running. I think that's the best way to loose weight and get in shape for me, but I haven't been able to run distance yet",I wish we could go to the track to run in our free time,Nope
To help me have a successful future,We spent more time waiting then training,We waited for nothing a lot,Start the training sooner

To get a degree ,The food was disgusting I would have rather gone to the DFAC since we need fuel to train hard and the protein to carb ratio on the meals is not good for recovery. ,They food is not good at BCT. ,Serve better foods like chicken beef and white rice instead of brown rice would be just fine.
